       <h1>System of Linear Equations</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A system of linear equations is a collection of two or more linear equations
          involving the same set of variables. These equations are typically written
          in the form:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + a₃x₃ + ... + aₙxₙ = b₁
          <br>a₁'x₁ + a₂'x₂ + a₃'x₃ + ... + aₙ'xₙ = b₁'
          <br>…
          <br>a₁ₖx₁ + a₂ₖx₂ + a₃ₖx₃ + ... + aₙₖxₙ = bₖ</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In this system of equations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ are the variables.</li>
          <li>a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., aₙ are the coefficients of the variables in the first
            equation.</li>
          <li>a₁', a₂', a₃', ..., aₙ' are the coefficients of the variables in the second
            equation, and so on for all k equations.</li>
          <li>b₁, b₁', ..., bₖ are constants on the right-hand side of each equation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The goal in solving a system of linear equations is to find values for
          the variables (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) that satisfy all the equations simultaneously.
          These values are called the "solutions" to the system. If there is a unique
          solution, then the system is said to be "consistent." If there are no solutions,
          it is "inconsistent." If there are infinitely many solutions, it is "dependent"
          or "underdetermined."</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">One common method for solving systems of linear equations is using techniques
          like Gaussian elimination, matrix algebra, or substitution. These methods
          help find the values of the variables that make all the equations true
          at the same time. Systems of linear equations are widely used in various
          fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, economics, and more,
          to model and solve real-world problems.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Well-Conditioned System</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A well-conditioned system of equations is one where the matrix of coefficients
            is such that small changes in the input data (e.g., the right-hand side
            or coefficients of the equations) result in small changes in the solution.</li>
          <li>Mathematically, a system is considered well-conditioned if its condition
            number (usually denoted as κ) is relatively small. The condition number
            measures how sensitive the solution is to changes in the input data. A
            small condition number (κ ≈ 1) indicates good conditioning.</li>
          <li>In practical terms, a well-conditioned system is one where the numerical
            algorithms used for solving it (e.g., Gaussian elimination, iterative methods
            like Gauss-Seidel) perform reliably and produce accurate results without
            significant amplification of errors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Ill-Conditioned System</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>An ill-conditioned system of equations is one where small changes in the
            input data lead to large changes in the solution. In other words, the numerical
            solution is highly sensitive to perturbations in the input data.</li>
          <li>Mathematically, an ill-conditioned system has a large condition number
            (κ &gt;&gt; 1). A large condition number indicates poor conditioning and
            suggests that the system is susceptible to numerical instability.</li>
          <li>Solving ill-conditioned systems can be challenging because even small
            errors in the input data or during the numerical solution process can lead
            to significant inaccuracies in the computed solution. In extreme cases,
            it may be impossible to obtain a reliable solution.</li>
