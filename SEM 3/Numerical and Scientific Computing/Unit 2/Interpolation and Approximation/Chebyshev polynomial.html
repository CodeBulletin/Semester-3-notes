       <h1>Chebyshev polynomial</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Chebyshev polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials that have
          many applications in various fields of mathematics, science, and engineering</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Chebyshev polynomials are typically denoted as&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_n(x)\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(U_n(x)\)</span>, where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is
            a non-negative integer, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is
            a real number.</p>
        <p>There are two commonly used sequences of Chebyshev polynomials: the Chebyshev
          polynomials of the first kind&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_n(x)\)</span>&nbsp;and
          the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(U_n(x)\)</span>.</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">Chebyshev Polynomials of the First Kind&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_n(x)\)</span>:
            <br>The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are defined by the recurrence
            relation:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_0(x) = 1\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_1(x) = x\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_n(x) = 2x*T_{n-1}(x) - T_{n-2}(x)\)</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(n \ge 1\)</span>
              <br>These polynomials have many important properties, including:
              <ul>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;">They are orthogonal with respect to the weight function&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(w(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\)</span>&nbsp;on
                  the interval&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\([-1, 1]\)</span>.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;">They are bounded within the interval&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\([-1, 1]\)</span>,
                  with their maximum and minimum values being Â±1.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;">They are used in various numerical analysis and approximation techniques,
                  such as Chebyshev interpolation and Chebyshev spectral methods.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Chebyshev Polynomials of the Second Kind&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(U_n(x)\)</span>:
            <br>The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are defined by the recurrence
            relation:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(U_0(x) = 1\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(U_1(x) = 2x\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(U_n(x) = 2x*U_{n-1}(x) - U_{n-2}(x)\)</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(n \ge 1\)</span>
              <br>Like the first kind, these polynomials also have important properties
              and applications, though they are not orthogonal.</li>
