       <h1>Lagrange&#39;s Interpolation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Lagrange interpolation is a method for constructing a polynomial that
          passes through a set of given data points. It's a technique used in numerical
          analysis and mathematics to approximate a function when you have a discrete
          set of data points but want to find values between those points.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The key idea behind Lagrange interpolation is to construct a polynomial
          of the lowest possible degree that passes through all the given data points.
          This polynomial is known as the Lagrange polynomial, and it's represented
          as a weighted sum of basis polynomials.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Lagrange interpolation formula finds the lowest order polynominal
            L(x) which interpolates the points (x_i, y_i)</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Formula:&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Suppose you have a set of data points&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)\)</span>,
            where each&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>&nbsp;represents
            a data point.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Lagrange's Polynominal is given by:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(L(x) = \sum_{i=0}^ny_il_i(x)\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(l_i(x) = \prod_{j=0; j \ne i}^{n}\frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j}\)</span>
