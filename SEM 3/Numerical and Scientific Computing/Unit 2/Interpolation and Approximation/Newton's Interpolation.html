       <h1>Newton&#39;s Interpolation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Newton's interpolation, specifically Newton's divided difference interpolation,
          is another mathematical method for constructing a polynomial that approximates
          a function based on a given set of data points. Like Lagrange interpolation,
          it is used in numerical analysis and mathematics to estimate values between
          known data points. Newton's interpolation, however, is often favored for
          its simplicity and computational efficiency.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Newton's divided difference interpolation has some advantages over Lagrange
          interpolation. It is particularly well-suited for situations where you
          want to add additional data points without having to completely recompute
          the interpolating polynomial. You can simply update the divided differences
          based on the new data points.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">While Newton's interpolation is a useful technique, it shares the potential
          issue of high-degree polynomials with Lagrange interpolation, which can
          lead to numerical instability for a large number of data points. In practice,
          it's important to consider the specific characteristics of your data and
          the desired accuracy when choosing between interpolation methods.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Suppose you have a set of data points&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x_0, y_0),(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)\)</span>,
          where each&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>&nbsp;represents
          a data point.</p>
          <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Divided Difference</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how Newton's divided difference interpolation works:</p>

          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">where,
