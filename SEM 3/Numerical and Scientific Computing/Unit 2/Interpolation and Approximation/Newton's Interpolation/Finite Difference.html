       <h1>Finite Difference</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>Finite differences are a mathematical and numerical technique used to
          approximate the derivatives of a function. They are particularly useful
          when you have discrete data points or when you want to compute derivatives
          for functions that are challenging to differentiate analytically.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The basic idea behind finite differences is to estimate the derivative
          of a function at a specific point by considering the differences in function
          values at nearby points. There are three common types of finite differences:</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Forward Difference:</strong> The forward difference is used to
            approximate the first derivative of a function at a point x₀. It is computed
            as follows:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">f'(x₀) ≈ (f(x₀ + h) - f(x₀)) / h</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here, h is a small step size or interval. As h approaches zero, the approximation
              becomes more accurate and approaches the true derivative.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Backward Difference:</strong> The backward difference is another
              way to approximate the first derivative, but it uses values from points
              before the point x₀. It is computed as follows:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">f'(x₀) ≈ (f(x₀) - f(x₀ - h)) / h</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Like the forward difference, as h approaches zero, the backward difference
              becomes a more accurate estimate of the derivative.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Central Difference:</strong> The central difference is often used
              to approximate the first derivative as well, but it takes into account
              values both before and after the point x₀. It is computed as follows:</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;">f'(x₀) ≈ (f(x₀ + h) - f(x₀ - h)) / (2h)</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">The central difference tends to provide a more accurate estimate than
                the forward or backward difference for small values of h.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Higher-order finite differences can also be used to estimate higher-order
                derivatives. For example, the second derivative can be approximated using
                finite differences, which can be useful for solving differential equations
                or optimizing functions.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Finite differences are extensively used in numerical analysis, scientific
                computing, and various fields of engineering and science. They play a crucial
                role in numerical methods for solving differential equations, approximating
                integrals, and solving optimization problems when the analytical derivatives
                of functions are not readily available or are too complex to compute.</p>
              <h2
              style="margin-left:0px;">Higher Order</h2>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Second-Order (Central) Finite Difference for the Second Derivative:</strong>
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">To approximate the second derivative f''(x₀) of a function at a point
                  x₀ using central differences:</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">f''(x₀) ≈ (f(x₀ + h) - 2f(x₀) + f(x₀ - h)) / h²</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">This formula uses three data points: f(x₀ - h), f(x₀), and f(x₀ + h) to
                  estimate the second derivative.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Third-Order Finite Difference for the Third Derivative:</strong>
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">To approximate the third derivative f'''(x₀) using finite differences,
                  you would use more data points and a more complex formula:</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">f'''(x₀) ≈ (f(x₀ - 2h) - 2f(x₀ - h) + 2f(x₀ + h) - f(x₀ + 2h)) / (2h³)</p>
                <p
                style="margin-left:0px;">This formula employs five data points: f(x₀ - 2h), f(x₀ - h), f(x₀), f(x₀
                  + h), and f(x₀ + 2h).</p>
