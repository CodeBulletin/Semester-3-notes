       <h1>Gauss Elimination</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Gaussian elimination, also known as Gaussian elimination method or row
          reduction, is a widely used technique for solving systems of linear equations
          and finding the solutions for the variables. It's named after the German
          mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss but was independently discovered by
          other mathematicians as well.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The primary goal of Gaussian elimination is to transform a system of linear
          equations into an equivalent, simpler system (using row or column operations)that
          is easier to solve.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">What is partial pivoting and what is its use</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">when solving systems of linear equations. It involves selecting the pivot
          element (the leading coefficient) in each step of the elimination process
          to ensure that it has the largest absolute value among the coefficients
          in its column. The pivot element is the element that is used as a multiplier
          to eliminate other elements below it in the matrix during the row reduction
          process.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The primary purpose of partial pivoting is to improve the numerical stability
          and accuracy of the Gaussian elimination method.</p>
