       <h1>Refinement of solutions</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Refinement of solutions in solving systems of linear equations is a technique
          used to improve the accuracy of a solution obtained by numerical methods.
          Numerical solutions to linear systems, such as those obtained through methods
          like LU Decomposition, Gaussian Elimination, or iterative methods, can
          be imprecise due to rounding errors and other computational limitations.
          Refinement steps help reduce these errors and provide a more accurate solution.
          Here's a general approach to refining solutions:</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 1: Obtain an Initial Solution</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">First, solve the system using your chosen numerical method to get an initial
          solution. Let's denote this solution as&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_0\)</span>
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 2: Calculate the Residual</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The residual vector,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(r\)</span>, is the
          difference between the right-hand side of the equation and the product
          of the matrix and the initial solution. For a system&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(Ax=b\)</span>,
          the residual is calculated as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(r=b-Ax_0\)</span>
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 3: Solve for the Error</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Treat the residual as a new right-hand side and solve the system&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(Ae=r\)</span>&nbsp;to find the error term&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(e\)</span>.
            You can use the same decomposition (e.g., LU) used to solve the original
            system.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 4: Update the Solution</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Adjust your initial solution with the error term:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(x_1=x_0+e\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">This updated solution&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_1\)</span>​ is typically
          more accurate than the initial solution&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_0\)</span>​.</p>
        <h3
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 5: Iterate if Necessary</strong>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">If the residual is still larger than your desired tolerance, you can repeat
            the refinement process with&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_1\)</span>&nbsp;as
            the new initial solution.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Considerations</strong></h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tolerance:</strong> Before starting, decide on a tolerance level
              for the accuracy of your solution. This will dictate when you can stop
              the refinement process.</li>
            <li><strong>Convergence:</strong> Check if the refinement is converging towards
              a solution. If the residual does not decrease significantly after a few
              iterations, there may be issues with the system or the numerical method
              used.</li>
            <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Be aware that not all problems are well-suited
              for refinement. In some cases, the system of equations might be ill-conditioned,
              meaning that small errors in data can lead to large errors in the solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Computational Cost:</strong> Each refinement step involves additional
              computations. Balance the need for accuracy with the available computational
              resources.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Refinement is particularly useful in engineering and scientific computations
            where high accuracy is required. It's a powerful tool to enhance the reliability
            of solutions obtained from numerical methods.</p>
