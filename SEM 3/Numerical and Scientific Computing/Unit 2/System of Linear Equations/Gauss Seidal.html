       <h1>Gauss Seidal</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative numerical technique used for solving
          systems of linear equations. It's often employed when you have a large
          system of linear equations and you want to find an approximate solution</p>
        <p>Gauss-Seidel generally converges faster than Gauss-Jacobi. In Gauss-Jacobi,
          all the values from the previous iteration are used to calculate the values
          for the next iteration. In contrast, Gauss-Seidel uses updated values as
          soon as they become available. This leads to quicker convergence in many
          cases, which means you need fewer iterations to reach a solution.</p>
        <h2>Rate of Convergence of Gauss Seidal Method</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The rate of convergence of the Gauss-Seidel method depends on the characteristics
          of the system of linear equations being solved. In particular, the rate
          of convergence is influenced by the properties of the coefficient matrix
          and the initial guess for the solution. Here are some key factors that
          affect the rate of convergence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Diagonal Dominance</strong>: The rate of convergence is typically
            faster when the coefficient matrix is diagonally dominant. Diagonal dominance
            means that the absolute value of each diagonal element is greater than
            the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements in the same
            row. When the matrix is diagonally dominant, Gauss-Seidel often converges
            rapidly.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Spectral Radius</strong>: The convergence rate can be quantified
            using the spectral radius (ρ) of the iteration matrix. The iteration matrix
            is obtained by dividing each row of the coefficient matrix by its corresponding
            diagonal element. If ρ is less than 1, the method converges, and the closer
            ρ is to 1, the slower the convergence. If ρ is very close to 0, convergence
            is rapid.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Initial Guess</strong>: The choice of the initial guess also affects
            the rate of convergence. A good initial guess that is closer to the actual
            solution can lead to faster convergence. Conversely, a poor initial guess
            may result in slow convergence or divergence.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Eigenvalues</strong>: The eigenvalues of the iteration matrix
            can provide insights into the convergence behavior. If all the eigenvalues
            are close to zero, it indicates slow convergence, while eigenvalues significantly
            less than 1 suggest faster convergence.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Matrix Conditioning</strong>: The condition number of the coefficient
            matrix can impact convergence. If the matrix is ill-conditioned, meaning
            it has a high condition number, convergence may be slow. Conditioning issues
            can result in numerical instability.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In practice, the rate of convergence of Gauss-Seidel is often assessed
          empirically, and adjustments may be made to improve convergence. For example,
          relaxation techniques like successive over-relaxation (SOR) can be used
          to accelerate convergence in some cases.</p>
