       <h1>Gauss Seidal</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative numerical technique used for solving
          systems of linear equations. It's often employed when you have a large
          system of linear equations and you want to find an approximate solution</p>
        <p>Gauss-Seidel generally converges faster than Gauss-Jacobi. In Gauss-Jacobi,
          all the values from the previous iteration are used to calculate the values
          for the next iteration. In contrast, Gauss-Seidel uses updated values as
          soon as they become available. This leads to quicker convergence in many
          cases, which means you need fewer iterations to reach a solution.</p>
        <h2>Rate of Convergence of Gauss Seidal Method</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The convergence rate of the Gauss-Seidel method for linear equations depends
          on the system's characteristics. Key factors include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Diagonal Dominance</strong>: Faster convergence if the matrix
            is diagonally dominant, where diagonal elements outweigh the sum of off-diagonal
            elements in each row.</li>
          <li><strong>Spectral Radius</strong>: Convergence rate relates to the spectral
            radius (ρ) of the iteration matrix. Lower ρ indicates faster convergence.</li>
          <li><strong>Initial Guess</strong>: A closer initial guess to the actual solution
            speeds up convergence, while a poor guess may slow it down or cause divergence.</li>
          <li><strong>Eigenvalues</strong>: Eigenvalues near zero suggest slow convergence;
            values significantly less than 1 indicate faster convergence.</li>
          <li><strong>Matrix Conditioning</strong>: Ill-conditioned matrices (high condition
            number) may slow convergence.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Convergence is often assessed empirically, with techniques like successive
          over-relaxation (SOR) sometimes used to enhance it.</p>
