      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Gauss-Jacobi method is an iterative numerical technique used to solve
          systems of linear equations, which are mathematical equations involving
          multiple variables and their linear relationships. This method is named
          after the mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.
          its is particularly useful for solving large systems of linear equations.</p>
