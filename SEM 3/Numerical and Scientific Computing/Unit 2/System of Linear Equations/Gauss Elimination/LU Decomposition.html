       <h1>LU Decomposition</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">LU decomposition, short for " Lower-Upper Decomposition," is a matrix
          factorization method used in linear algebra to decompose a square matrix
          A into the product of two matrices: a lower triangular matrix (L) and an
          upper triangular matrix (U). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">A = LU</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A is the original square matrix you want to decompose.</li>
            <li>L is the lower triangular matrix, which has zeros above the main diagonal
              (the diagonal running from the top-left to the bottom-right) and ones on
              the main diagonal.</li>
            <li>U is the upper triangular matrix, which has zeros below the main diagonal.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">LU decomposition is particularly useful when you need to solve the same
            system of equations for different right-hand sides (different b vectors)
            with the same coefficient matrix A. After performing the LU decomposition
            of A once, you can solve for x for different b vectors more efficiently
            because the back-substitution step for Ux = y is relatively fast.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">Additionally, LU decomposition is numerically stable and avoids some of
            the issues related to division by small numbers that can occur in Gaussian
            elimination with partial pivoting. It is a fundamental technique in numerical
            linear algebra and is widely used in scientific and engineering computations.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;">Method:</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Suppose A =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33}\end{bmatrix}\)</span>
              </p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Convert A into L using Row Operations&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} &amp; b_{13} \\ 0 &amp; b_{22} &amp; b_{23} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; b_{33} \end{bmatrix}\)</span>and
                use the additive inverse of Row Operations to create matrix U =&nbsp;
                <span
                class="math-tex">\(\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; &nbsp;0 &amp; 0 \\ c_{21} &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                  c_{31} &amp; c_{32} &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}\)</span>
              </p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Such That LU = A</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">To Solve A system of equation using LU Decomposition&nbsp;</p>
              <ol>
                <li>first convert A in AX = B to A = LU&nbsp;
                  <ol>
                    <li>LUX = B</li>
                    <li>Let UX = Y</li>
                    <li>Then LY = B,</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>First Solve LY = B then UX = Y</li>
