       <h1>Interpolation and Approximation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Interpolation is a mathematical and computational technique used to estimate
          values between two or more known data points. It is commonly used in various
          fields, including mathematics, computer science, engineering, and data
          analysis, to fill in the gaps between existing data points or to approximate
          values at points within a given range.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The basic idea behind interpolation is to construct a continuous function
          that passes through the known data points, allowing you to make educated
          guesses or predictions about the values at intermediate points. This can
          be particularly useful when you have discrete data points and need to estimate
          values at non-discrete positions.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are several methods of interpolation, including:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Linear Interpolation:</strong> This is the simplest form of interpolation,
          where a straight line is drawn between two adjacent data points. The value
          at any point along the line is determined by the equation of the line connecting
          the two neighboring data points.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Polynomial Interpolation:</strong> In this method, a polynomial
          function is used to fit the data points exactly. The most common form of
          polynomial interpolation is the Lagrange polynomial or Newton's divided
          difference method.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Spline Interpolation:</strong> Spline interpolation divides the
          range into smaller segments and fits a piecewise polynomial to each segment.
          This approach provides a smooth and continuous curve that passes through
          all the data points.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cubic Interpolation:</strong> Cubic interpolation is a specific
          type of spline interpolation that uses cubic polynomials for each segment.
          It is often favored because it produces a smooth curve and is computationally
          efficient.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bézier Interpolation:</strong> Bézier curves are often used in
          computer graphics and design applications. They are defined by control
          points and can be used to smoothly interpolate between these points.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Piecewise Interpolation:</strong> This method involves breaking
          the data range into pieces and using different interpolation methods in
          each piece. It's a flexible approach that can handle data with varying
          characteristics.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The choice of interpolation method depends on the specific problem, the
            nature of the data, and the desired accuracy of the interpolated values.
            It's important to note that while interpolation can be a useful tool for
            estimating values between known data points, it may not always be appropriate
            if the underlying data has irregularities or outliers, in which case other
            techniques like curve fitting or regression analysis may be more suitable.</p>
