       <h1>Secant Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Secant Method is a numerical technique used for finding approximate
          solutions to equations, specifically to find the roots of a continuous
          function. It's an iterative method that refines the estimate of a root
          with each iteration. The Secant Method is an improvement over the Bisection
          Method and the Regula Falsi Method in terms of convergence speed, as it
          can converge faster when the function's behavior is well-behaved.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how the Secant Method works:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Choose two initial points,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_0, x_1\)</span>&nbsp;that
            are reasonably close to the root.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Calculate the function values&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x_0)\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(f(x_1)\)</span>&nbsp;at these initial points.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Compute the next approximation to the root using linear interpolation.
            The formula for this is:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(x_{n+1} = \frac{x_nf(x_{n-1}) - &nbsp;x_{n-1}f(x_n)}{f(x_{n-1}) -f(x_{n})}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Update the values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_{n-1}\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(x_n\)</span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_n\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
              <span
              class="math-tex">\(x_{n+1}\)</span>, respectively, for the next iteration.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Repeat steps 2 to 4 iteratively until the desired level of accuracy is
            achieved.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Secant Method essentially uses the slope of the secant line connecting
            the points&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x_{n-1}, f(x_{n-1}))\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\((x_{n}, f(x_{n}))\)</span>&nbsp;to estimate where the root might be.
              This linear interpolation helps the method converge more quickly than linear
              methods like the Bisection and Regula Falsi methods</p>
          <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Order of Convergence</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">
            <br>The order of convergence of the Secant Method is approximately 1.6181.618
            or the golden ratio <i>ϕ</i>. The order of convergence indicates how quickly
            the method converges to the root as the number of iterations increases.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">The Secant Method exhibits superlinear convergence, which is faster than
            linear convergence (as seen in methods like the Bisection or Regula Falsi
            methods), but generally slower than quadratic convergence (as seen in methods
            like Newton's Method under certain conditions).</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Mathematically, if&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(e_n\)</span>​ represents
              the error in the&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n^{th}\)</span>&nbsp;iteration
              (the difference between the true root and the approximation obtained after
              n iterations), the order of convergence p of the Secant Method can be estimated
              by looking at the limit:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(p \approx \frac{log(\frac{|e_{n+1}|}{|e_n|})}{log(\frac{|e_{n}|}{|e_{n-1}|})}\)</span>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">If the limit above converges to a value close to 1.618 (the golden ratio <i>ϕ</i>),
              it indicates that the method's order of convergence is superlinear and
              is around the golden ratio.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">This means that in each iteration, the number of accurate digits approximately
              increases by a factor of 1.6181.618, making the Secant Method relatively
              faster than linear methods but not as fast as quadratic methods. However,
              it's important to note that the order of convergence might vary depending
              on the specific behavior of the function and the choice of initial points.</p>
