       <h1>Biscetion Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The bisection method is a simple iterative numerical technique used to
          find the root of a real-valued function. The root of a function is the
          point at which the function equals zero. This method is particularly useful
          for functions that are continuous and have a single root within a given
          interval.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how the bisection method works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Interval Selection</strong>: Start with an initial interval [a,
            b] where the function changes sign (i.e., f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs).
            This ensures that there is at least one root within the interval.</li>
          <li><strong>Midpoint Calculation</strong>: Calculate the midpoint of the interval,&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(c = \frac{a+b}{2}\)</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Function Evaluation</strong>: Evaluate the function at the midpoint,&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(f(c)\)</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Root Refinement</strong>: Determine the subinterval [a, c] or
            [c, b] where the sign of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(c)\)</span>&nbsp;is
            opposite to the sign of either&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(a)\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(f(b)\)</span>. This subinterval is guaranteed to contain the root.</li>
          <li><strong>Iteration</strong>: Repeat steps 2 to 4 using the new subinterval
            as the interval. Continue this process iteratively until the width of the
            interval becomes sufficiently small or until a desired level of accuracy
            is achieved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The bisection method converges to the root of the function at a linear
          rate, meaning that with each iteration, the error is halved. This makes
          it a very reliable method for finding roots, especially when a high level
          of accuracy is needed or when other methods might be less stable.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">However, the bisection method may converge relatively slowly, especially
          when compared to more advanced methods like Newton's method or secant method,
          which converge faster in many cases. Additionally, the bisection method
          requires that the initial interval is chosen such that it contains a root
          and the function changes sign within the interval. If these conditions
          are not met, the method might not work as expected.</p>
          <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Order of Convergence</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Order of convergence of the Bisection Method is linear. This means
            that with each iteration of the method, the error is approximately halved.
            In mathematical terms, the error (the difference between the approximation
            and the true root) decreases by a constant factor in each iteration.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">The bisection method divides the interval in which the root is believed
            to exist into two equal subintervals and selects the subinterval that contains
            the root based on the Intermediate Value Theorem. The process is repeated
            iteratively, with each iteration narrowing down the interval where the
            root lies. The error at each step is reduced by a factor of 1/2, leading
            to linear convergence.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Mathematically, the rate of convergence of bisection method can be expressed
              as follows:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(|e_{n+1}| = C * |e_n|^k\)</span>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="math-tex">\(e_{n+1}\)</span>&nbsp;is the error in the (n+1)-th
                iteration.</li>
              <li><span class="math-tex">\(e_n\)</span>&nbsp;is the error in the n-th iteration.</li>
              <li>C is a constant factor =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac12\)</span>.</li>
              <li>k is order of convergence = 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">The linear convergence rate of the bisection method makes it relatively
              slow compared to other root-finding methods like Newton's method or the
              secant method, especially when the initial interval is large or the function
              is not well-behaved. However, one advantage of the bisection method is
              its reliability and guaranteed convergence for continuous functions with
              a change of sign within the interval.</p>
