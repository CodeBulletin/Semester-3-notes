       <h1>Newtons Raphson Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Newton's Method, also known as the Newton-Raphson Method, is a widely
          used iterative numerical technique for finding approximations to the roots
          of a real-valued function. It is a powerful method for finding solutions
          to equations but requires knowledge of the function's derivative. The method
          is particularly effective when the initial guess is close to the actual
          root and the function is well-behaved.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how Newton's Method works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with an initial guess&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_0\)</span>â€‹
            close to the root of the function&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x)\)</span>.</li>
          <li>Calculate the function value&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x_n)\)</span>&nbsp;and
            its derivative&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f'(x_n)\)</span>&nbsp;at the
            initial guess.</li>
          <li>Compute the next approximation to the root using the formula:
            <br><span class="math-tex">\(x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\)</span>
          </li>
          <li>Update the value of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_{n+1}\)</span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(x_n\)</span>&nbsp;and repeat steps 2 and 3 iteratively until the desired
              level of accuracy is achieved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The main idea behind Newton's Method is to use a linear approximation
          of the function at the current point to estimate the next root approximation.
          The method effectively follows the tangent line to the function at the
          current point and finds where it intersects the x-axis, which should be
          closer to the root of the original function.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Newton's Method can converge rapidly, typically with quadratic convergence,
          meaning that with each iteration, the number of accurate digits roughly
          doubles. This rapid convergence is a major advantage of the method when
          compared to linear methods like the Bisection or Regula Falsi methods.
          However, Newton's Method is sensitive to the choice of initial guess and
          might fail to converge or converge to a different root if the initial guess
          is not sufficiently close to the actual root or if the function has multiple
          roots in close proximity.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To summarize, Newton's Method is a powerful iterative technique for finding
          roots of functions when the derivative is available. It can converge quickly
          but requires careful consideration of the initial guess and the behavior
          of the function.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Order of Convergence of Newton's method</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The order of convergence of Newton's Method is quadratic, meaning that
          the number of accurate digits roughly doubles with each iteration. This
          rapid convergence is one of the key strengths of the method when compared
          to linear methods like the Bisection or Regula Falsi methods.</p>
