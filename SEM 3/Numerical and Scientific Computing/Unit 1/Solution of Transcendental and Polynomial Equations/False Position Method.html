       <h1>False Position Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The False Position Method, also known as the Regula Falsi Method or the
          Linear Interpolation Method, is a root-finding algorithm used in numerical
          analysis to approximate the roots of a continuous function. Similar to
          the Bisection Method, it operates on an interval where the function changes
          sign, aiming to refine the estimate of the root with each iteration. However,
          the False Position Method employs linear interpolation to make a more informed
          estimate of the root compared to the simple bisection approach.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how the False Position Method works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with an interval [a, b] where the function changes sign. Calculate
            the function values f(a) and f(b).</li>
          <li>Compute the point x that corresponds to the intersection of the straight
            line connecting the points (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) with the x-axis. This
            point is given by:
            <br><span class="math-tex">\(x= \frac{af(b) - bf(a)}{f(b) -f(a)}\)</span>
          </li>
          <li>Calculate the function value f(x) at the newly computed point x.</li>
          <li>Determine whether the root lies between a and x or between x and b based
            on the signs of f(a) and f(x).</li>
          <li>Update the interval [a, b] to [a, x] or [x, b], depending on the location
            of the root.</li>
          <li>Repeat the process iteratively, calculating new values of x and updating
            the interval until a desired level of accuracy is achieved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The False Position Method shares some similarities with the Bisection
          Method, as both methods work with an interval that contains the root and
          narrow it down with each iteration. However, the False Position Method
          typically converges faster than the Bisection Method because it incorporates
          more information about the function's behavior by using linear interpolation.</p>
        <h2
        style="margin-left:0px;">Order of Convergence</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">
            <br>The Order of convergence of the Regula Falsi (False Position) Method is
            linear. This means that, similar to the Bisection Method, the error decreases
            by a constant factor with each iteration. However, compared to the Bisection
            Method, the linear convergence of the Regula Falsi Method is generally
            faster, since it uses linear interpolation to estimate the root and incorporates
            more information about the function's behavior.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">In mathematical terms, the Order of convergence can be expressed as follows:</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(|e_{n+1}| = C * |e_n|^k\)</span>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="math-tex">\(e_{n+1}\)</span>&nbsp;is the error in the (n+1)-th
                iteration.</li>
              <li><span class="math-tex">\(e_n\)</span>&nbsp;is the error in the n-th iteration.</li>
              <li>C is a constant factor less than 1.</li>
              <li>k is order of Convergence for Regula Falsi Method it is 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Regula Falsi Method has a slightly faster convergence rate compared
              to the Bisection Method because it uses linear interpolation to estimate
              the root, which takes into account the local behavior of the function.</p>
