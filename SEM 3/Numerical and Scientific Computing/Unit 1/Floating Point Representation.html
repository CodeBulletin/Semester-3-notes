       <h1>Floating Point Representation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>What is Floating Point Representation?</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Floating-point representation is a method used in computing to represent
          and store real numbers, which include both rational and irrational numbers.
          It is a way of approximating real numbers with a finite number of bits
          (binary digits) in a computer's memory. The term "floating-point" comes
          from the fact that the decimal point (or binary point in this case) can
          "float" to represent a wide range of values, both large and small, by adjusting
          the exponent.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The representation consists of three main components:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Sign bit: A single bit that indicates whether the number is positive or
          negative. 0 typically represents positive, and 1 represents negative.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Exponent: A fixed number of bits used to represent the scale or magnitude
          of the number. By adjusting the exponent, floating-point numbers can cover
          a wide range of magnitudes.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Mantissa (also known as fraction or significand): Another fixed number
            of bits that represents the precision or fractional part of the number.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">The basic idea is to store the number in scientific notation (base 2),
            where the number is expressed as a product of two parts: the significand
            and 2 raised to the power of the exponent.</p>
            <h2>What are the Pitfalls of floating point representation?</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Floating-point representation, while widely used and versatile, has some
              inherent pitfalls and limitations that programmers and developers should
              be aware of:</p>
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Rounding Errors</strong>: Floating-point numbers can only approximate
                real numbers. Some real numbers cannot be represented precisely using a
                finite number of bits, leading to rounding errors. These errors can accumulate
                during computations and cause unexpected results in certain situations.</li>
              <li
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limited Precision</strong>: Floating-point numbers have limited
                precision due to the finite number of bits used to represent the fractional
                part (mantissa). Operations involving very small or very large numbers
                may lose precision, resulting in inaccuracies.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Non-Associativity</strong>: The lack of associativity in floating-point
                  arithmetic means that the order in which operations are performed can affect
                  the final result. This behavior can lead to unexpected results when performing
                  seemingly straightforward computations.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Inexact Representations</strong>: Some decimal numbers (e.g.,
                  0.1) cannot be represented exactly in binary floating-point format, leading
                  to small discrepancies between the real number and its floating-point representation.</li>
                <li
                style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Denormalized Numbers</strong>: Very small numbers close to zero
                  (subnormal or denormalized numbers) are represented with reduced precision,
                  which can lead to additional loss of accuracy during calculations.</li>
                  <li
                  style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Overflow and Underflow</strong>: Floating-point representations
                    have finite ranges for exponents, and numbers that exceed these ranges
                    can cause overflow (resulting in positive or negative infinity) or underflow
                    (resulting in zero or a subnormal number).</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>NaN and Infinity</strong>: Special values like NaN (Not-a-Number)
                      and positive/negative infinity can occur as results of certain operations,
                      making it crucial to handle these exceptional cases correctly.</li>
                    <li
                    style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparisons</strong>: Due to rounding errors, comparing floating-point
                      numbers for equality can be tricky. It is generally recommended to use
                      an epsilon-based comparison (checking if the absolute difference between
                      two numbers is below a small threshold) instead of direct equality checks.</li>
                      <li
                      style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Portability Issues</strong>: Different hardware and programming
                        languages may use different floating-point representations, leading to
                        portability issues when transferring data between platforms.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Performance Trade-offs</strong>: Floating-point operations are
                          typically slower than integer operations, and the use of floating-point
                          arithmetic can impact the performance of certain algorithms, especially
                          on resource-constrained systems.</li>
