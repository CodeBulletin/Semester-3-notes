       <h1>Numerical Errors</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Numerical errors refer to inaccuracies or deviations that occur when performing
          calculations with finite precision arithmetic on digital computers. These
          errors can arise due to the limitations of representing real numbers using
          a fixed number of digits or bits in a computer's memory.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Numerical errors can have various consequences:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Loss of Accuracy</strong>: The calculated result may differ significantly
            from the true mathematical value due to accumulated errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Instability</strong>: Certain algorithms or computations may become
            unstable and produce wildly divergent results as errors accumulate.</li>
          <li><strong>Convergence Issues</strong>: Numerical errors can affect the convergence
            of iterative algorithms, making them converge much slower or not at all.</li>
          <li><strong>Incorrect Decisions</strong>: In scientific simulations and engineering
            applications, small numerical errors can lead to incorrect decisions and
            predictions.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Types of Numerical Errors</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inherent Error</strong>:
            <br>This term generally refers to errors that are inherent to a process or
            measurement due to its nature. It could be errors caused by limitations
            in equipment, environmental factors, or the fundamental principles involved
            in the process. In numerical computation, it might also refer to errors
            that are unavoidable due to the nature of representing real numbers in
            finite precision.
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Round Off Error</strong>:
            <br>Round-off error occurs when real numbers are approximated using a finite
            number of digits or bits. It's the discrepancy between the true value and
            the rounded value. This error accumulates in calculations, and it's a type
            of error caused by representing continuous values with discrete approximations.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x = 1.2775495\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{x} = 1.278\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(R = |x - \bar{x}| = 0.0004505\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Chopping Error</strong>:
            <br>Chopping error is a form of round-off error that occurs when a number
            is rounded down to a specific number of decimal places or significant figures.
            This can result in a loss of accuracy in calculations. Chopping is often
            used as a simplified representation of rounding for teaching purposes.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x = 1.2775495\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{x} = 1.277\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_c = |x - \bar{x}| = 0.0005495\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Truncation Error</strong>:&nbsp;
            <br>In numerical analysis and scientific computing, truncation error is an
            error caused by approximating a mathematical process. Truncation error
            results from ignoring all but a finite number of terms of an infinite series.
            For example, the exponential function ex may be expressed as the sum of
            the infinite series.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + ...\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{e^x} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_r = \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^6}{6!} + ...\)</span>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(e^1 = 2.71828182846\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{e^1} = 2.66666666667\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(err = |e^1 - \bar{e^1}| = 0.05161516178\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Absolute Error</strong>:
            <br>The absolute error is the difference between the measured or calculated
            value and the true or expected value. It gives you an idea of how far off
            your estimation is from the actual value, without considering the scale
            or magnitude of the values involved.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x = 1.27195\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{x} = 1.273\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_a = |x - \bar{x}| = 0.00105\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Relative Error</strong>:
            <br>The relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the true value.
            It's often expressed as a percentage. Relative error provides a way to
            compare the error to the size of the actual value, giving you a sense of
            the proportion of error.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_r = \frac{E_a}{x}\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_r = 0.00082550414\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Percentage Error</strong>:
            <br>Percentage error is the relative error expressed as a percentage of the
            true value. It's a way of quantifying how much the calculated value deviates
            from the true value in terms of a percentage of the true value.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_p = 100E_r\%\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_p = 0.082550414\%\)</span>
