       <h1>Solution of Transcendental and Polynomial Equations</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>What is Transcendental Equation</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A transcendental equation is an equation that involves transcendental
          functions on one side and constants or other expressions on the other side.
          Transcendental functions are functions that cannot be expressed in terms
          of a finite combination of algebraic operations (addition, subtraction,
          multiplication, division) and raising to integer powers.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In other words, transcendental equations involve functions like trigonometric
          functions (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.), exponential functions (such as&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(e^x\)</span>), logarithmic functions (such as&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(log(x)\)</span>),
            and other similar functions that cannot be simplified into polynomial expressions.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Transcendental equations often arise in mathematics, physics, engineering,
          and various scientific fields when dealing with problems that involve relationships
          described by these special functions. These equations are typically more
          challenging to solve compared to polynomial equations because transcendental
          functions do not have a simple algebraic structure.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Solving transcendental equations often requires numerical methods, iterative
            techniques, or approximations. In some cases, it might be impossible to
            find exact solutions analytically, and numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson
            method or iterative techniques might be used to find numerical approximations
            to the solutions.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Examples of transcendental equations include equations involving trigonometric
            functions like&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(sin(x) = 0.5\)</span>, exponential
            equations like&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(e^x = 3\)</span>, and logarithmic
            equations like&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(log(x) +x &nbsp;= 5\)</span>.
            These equations can describe various phenomena and relationships in the
            natural and mathematical sciences.</p>
          <h2>What is Polynomial Equation</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">A polynomial equation is an equation that involves a polynomial expression
            on one side and a constant or another expression on the other side. A polynomial
            expression is a mathematical expression made up of variables, coefficients,
            and non-negative integer exponents. In its most general form, a polynomial
            equation can be written as:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(P(x) = 0\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(P(x)\)</span>&nbsp;is a polynomial
            expression in the variable&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>, and
            the equation is set equal to zero. This equation represents the search
            for values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;(the roots
            or solutions) that make the polynomial expression equal to zero.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">A polynomial expression is typically a sum of terms, each consisting of
            a coefficient multiplied by a power of the variable&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>.
            The exponents are non-negative integers. For example,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(3x^2+2x-1\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(x^4 + 3x^2 -2x^2 - x + 1\)</span>&nbsp;are examples of polynomial expressions.</p>
              <p
              style="margin-left:0px;">The highest power of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;in
                a polynomial is known as the degree of the polynomial. The degree helps
                determine the behavior of the polynomial, including the number of possible
                roots and the overall shape of its graph.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">Polynomial equations are fundamental in mathematics and have numerous
                  applications in various fields, including algebra, calculus, geometry,
                  physics, engineering, and computer science. They are used to model relationships
                  between variables, solve problems, and analyze real-world situations. Depending
                  on the degree of the polynomial and the techniques available, solving polynomial
                  equations can range from straightforward to highly complex.</p>
                <h2>What are iterative Methods</h2>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">Iterative methods are techniques used in various fields of mathematics
                  and science to solve problems by repeatedly refining an initial guess or
                  approximation. These methods involve performing a series of iterative steps
                  to approach a desired solution, often improving the approximation with
                  each iteration until a specified level of accuracy is achieved. Iterative
                  methods are particularly useful for solving complex problems that do not
                  have closed-form solutions or for problems that involve large datasets
                  or numerical simulations.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here are a few examples of areas where iterative methods are commonly
                  used:</p>

                </ul>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;">In each of these areas, iterative methods allow practitioners to solve
                  complex problems that might not have straightforward analytical solutions.
