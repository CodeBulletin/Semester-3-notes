       <h1>Solution of Transcendental and Polynomial Equations</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Transcendental Equation:</strong> A transcendental equation involves
          transcendental functions, which are not expressible as finite combinations
          of basic algebraic operations and integer exponentiation. These include
          trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Common in various
          scientific fields, they are often more complex to solve than polynomial
          equations and may require numerical or iterative methods. Examples are
          equations like&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\text{sin}(x) = 0.5\)</span>,&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(e^x=1\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\text{log(x)} = 1\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Polynomial Equation:</strong> A polynomial equation involves a
          polynomial expression, which is made up of variables, coefficients, and
          non-negative integer exponents. These equations, written as&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(P(x) = 0\)</span>, seek values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;that
            satisfy the equation. Polynomial expressions are sums of terms with varying
            powers of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>. The degree of the polynomial
            influences its properties and solutions. Polynomial equations are central
            in mathematics and have widespread applications.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Iterative Methods:</strong> Iterative methods are techniques used
          to solve complex mathematical and scientific problems by refining initial
          approximations in a series of steps. They are essential in areas like numerical
          analysis for root-finding and solving linear systems, optimization techniques
          like gradient descent, numerical simulations in finite element methods
          and fluid dynamics, signal processing, machine learning model training,
          and data analysis. These methods balance computational effort with accuracy
          and flexibility.</p>
