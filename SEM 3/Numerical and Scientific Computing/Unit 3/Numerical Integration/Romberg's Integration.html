       <h1>Romberg&#39;s Integration</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Romberg integration is a numerical method used to approximate definite
          integrals. It is based on the trapezoidal rule and improves the accuracy
          of the approximation by extrapolating the results using a sequence of calculations.
          The Romberg integration algorithm involves repeatedly applying a formula
          to refine the estimate of the integral. This method can provide more accurate
          results compared to the trapezoidal rule alone.</p>
