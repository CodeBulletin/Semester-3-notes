       <h1>Simposon&#39;s Rule</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Simpson's rules are a family of numerical integration methods used to
          approximate definite integrals. They are based on approximating the area
          under a curve by using quadratic or cubic polynomials. The most commonly
          used Simpson's rule is Simpson's 1/3 rule, which divides the interval into
          subintervals and approximates the area under the curve in each subinterval
          using a quadratic polynomial. The rule assumes that the function is approximately
          quadratic between adjacent points. Simpson's 1/3 rule provides a more accurate
          approximation compared to the Trapezoidal rule, especially for functions
          that are smooth and have a relatively simple shape.</p>
        <p>In addition to Simpson's 1/3 rule, there is also Simpson's 3/8 rule, which
          uses cubic polynomials to approximate the area under the curve. This rule
          provides an even more accurate approximation, but it requires dividing
          the interval into subintervals that are multiples of three.</p>
