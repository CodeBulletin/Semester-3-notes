       <h1>Boole&#39;s Rule</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Boole's Rule is a numerical integration method used to approximate definite
          integrals. It is an extension of Simpson's 1/3 rule and provides a more
          accurate approximation by using a fourth-degree polynomial to approximate
          the area under the curve.</p>
        <p>Boole's Rule divides the interval into subintervals and approximates the
          area under the curve in each subinterval using a fourth-degree polynomial.
          The rule assumes that the function is approximately quartic between adjacent
          points. By integrating this polynomial over each subinterval and summing
          the results, Boole's Rule provides an approximation of the definite integral.</p>
        <p>Compared to Simpson's 1/3 rule and Simpson's 3/8 rule, Boole's Rule can
          provide even higher accuracy for numerical integration. However, it requires
          dividing the interval into subintervals that are multiples of four, which
          can be a limitation in some cases.</p>
        <p>It's worth noting that while Boole's Rule can provide accurate results
          for well-behaved functions, it may not be suitable for functions with irregular
          or oscillatory behavior. In such cases, other numerical integration methods
          or adaptive techniques may be more appropriate.</p>
