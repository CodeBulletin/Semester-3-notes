       <h1>Trapezoidal Rule</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Trapezoidal rule is a numerical integration method used to approximate
          the definite integral of a function. It is based on approximating the area
          under a curve by dividing it into trapezoids. The rule assumes that the
          function is approximately linear between adjacent points, and calculates
          the area of each trapezoid by taking the average of the function values
          at the two endpoints and multiplying it by the width of the interval. The
          sum of these areas gives an approximation of the integral. The accuracy
          of the approximation improves as the number of trapezoids increases. The
          Trapezoidal rule is a simple and commonly used method for numerical integration,
          especially when the function is not easily integrable analytically.</p>
