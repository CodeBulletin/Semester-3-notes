       <h1>Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Numerical methods are commonly used to solve ordinary differential equations
          (ODEs) when an analytical solution is not available or difficult to obtain.
          There are several numerical techniques that can be employed, such as Euler's
          method, the Runge-Kutta methods, and the finite difference methods.</p>
        <p>Euler's method is a simple and straightforward approach. It approximates
          the solution by taking small steps along the derivative of the function
          at each point. The method is based on the first-order Taylor series expansion
          and can be prone to accumulating errors over time.</p>
        <p>The Runge-Kutta methods are more accurate and widely used. The most commonly
          used variant is the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. It involves
          evaluating the derivative at multiple points within each step and using
          a weighted average to update the solution. RK4 is known for its accuracy
          and stability, making it a popular choice for solving ODEs numerically.</p>
        <p>Finite difference methods discretize the domain and approximate the derivatives
          using finite differences. The most common finite difference schemes are
          the forward difference, backward difference, and central difference methods.
          These methods can be used to convert the ODE into a system of algebraic
          equations, which can then be solved using various techniques like Gaussian
          elimination or iterative methods.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that the choice of numerical method depends on
          the specific problem and its characteristics. Some ODEs may require specialized
          techniques, such as stiff ODE solvers for problems with widely varying
          time scales. Additionally, adaptive step size control can be employed to
          improve accuracy and efficiency.</p>
