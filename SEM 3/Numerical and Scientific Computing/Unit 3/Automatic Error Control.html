       <h1>Automatic Error Control</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Automatic error monitoring, also known as error control or adaptive step
          size control, is a technique used in numerical methods for solving ordinary
          differential equations (ODEs) to ensure accurate and efficient approximation
          of the solution. It involves dynamically adjusting the step size during
          the numerical integration process based on the estimated error.</p>
        <p>In numerical methods like Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta methods, the
          step size determines the distance between consecutive points in the approximation.
          A smaller step size generally leads to a more accurate solution, but it
          also increases the computational cost. On the other hand, a larger step
          size reduces computational cost but may introduce larger errors.</p>
        <p>Automatic error monitoring addresses this trade-off by continuously monitoring
          the error during the integration process and adjusting the step size accordingly.
          The goal is to maintain a balance between accuracy and efficiency.</p>
        <p>Here's how automatic error monitoring typically works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with an initial step size, denoted as "hâ‚€."</li>
          <li>Perform a numerical integration step using the chosen method and the current
            step size.</li>
          <li>Estimate the error in the approximation by comparing the results obtained
            with two different step sizes, such as "h" and "h/2." This can be done
            by comparing the solution obtained with the smaller step size to the solution
            obtained with the larger step size.</li>
          <li>Compare the estimated error to a predefined tolerance or error threshold.
            If the estimated error is within the desired tolerance, the current step
            size is considered appropriate, and the integration continues.</li>
          <li>If the estimated error exceeds the tolerance, the step size is adjusted.
            Common strategies include reducing the step size to increase accuracy or
            increasing the step size to improve efficiency.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the desired range or number of points is reached.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By continuously monitoring the error and adjusting the step size accordingly,
          automatic error monitoring allows for adaptive control of the numerical
          integration process. This helps to ensure that the solution is accurate
          while minimizing unnecessary computational effort.</p>
