       <h1>Introduction to Numerical Differentiation and integration</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p><strong>Numerical differentiation</strong> is a technique used to approximate
          the derivative of a function at a given point. The derivative of a function
          represents its rate of change, or how the function's output value changes
          with respect to its input value.</p>
        <p><strong>Numerical integration</strong> is a technique used to approximate
          the definite integral of a function over a given interval. The definite
          integral represents the area under the curve of a function between two
          points.</p>
        <p>There are several methods for numerical integration, but the most commonly
          used ones include the midpoint rule, trapezoidal rule, and Simpson's rule.</p>
