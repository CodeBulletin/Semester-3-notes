       <h1>Gaussian Quadrature</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Gaussian Quadrature is an efficient numerical integration method that
          approximates a function's definite integral. It differs from methods like
          the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson's Rule by strategically choosing points
          and weights for evaluation to maximize accuracy, especially effective for
          smooth functions. Key concepts include approximating the integral as a
          weighted sum of function values at specific points, with optimal points
          (nodes) and weights derived from the roots of orthogonal polynomials, like
          Legendre polynomials. This method adapts well to different intervals and
          is highly accurate for polynomials up to a certain degree, depending on
          the number of nodes. Gaussian Quadrature is ideal for high-precision applications
          in science and engineering, offering high accuracy with fewer evaluations.</p>
