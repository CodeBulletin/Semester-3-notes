       <h1>Taylor’s series method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>
          <br>Taylor's series method is a numerical technique used to solve ordinary
          differential equations (ODEs) by approximating the solution as a power
          series expansion. It is based on Taylor's theorem, which states that a
          function can be represented as an infinite sum of its derivatives evaluated
          at a particular point.</p>
        <p>The Taylor's series method involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose a point (often denoted as "a") around which the Taylor series expansion
            will be centered.</li>
          <li>Assume that the solution to the ODE can be expressed as a power series
            expansion around the chosen point:
            <br>y(x) = y(a) + (x - a)y'(a) + (x - a)^2/2! y''(a) + (x - a)^3/3! y'''(a)
            + …
            <br>Here, y(x) represents the unknown solution, y(a) is the value of the solution
            at the chosen point, and y'(a), y''(a), y'''(a), etc., represent the derivatives
            of the solution evaluated at the chosen point.</li>
          <li>Substitute the power series expansion into the ODE and equate the coefficients
            of each power of (x - a) to zero. This will result in a system of equations
            involving the derivatives of the solution evaluated at the chosen point.</li>
          <li>Solve the system of equations to determine the values of the derivatives
            at the chosen point.</li>
          <li>Substitute the values of the derivatives back into the power series expansion
            to obtain an approximation of the solution.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The accuracy of the Taylor's series method depends on the number of terms
          included in the expansion. Including more terms will result in a more accurate
          approximation, but it may also increase the computational complexity. In
          practice, the expansion is often truncated after a certain number of terms
          to balance accuracy and efficiency.</p>
