       <h1>Picard&#39;s method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Picard's method, also known as the Picard iteration or the method of successive
          approximations, is an iterative technique used to solve ordinary differential
          equations (ODEs) numerically. It is based on the idea of approximating
          the solution by repeatedly refining an initial guess.</p>
        <p>The method is named after the French mathematician Charles Ã‰mile Picard,
          who introduced it in the late 19th century. Picard's method is particularly
          useful for solving initial value problems, where the solution is sought
          for a given initial condition.</p>
        <p>Here's how Picard's method works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with an initial guess for the solution. This guess can be any function
            that satisfies the given initial condition.</li>
          <li>Use the initial guess to construct an integral equation, known as the
            Picard integral equation. This equation involves integrating the right-hand
            side of the ODE with respect to the independent variable, using the initial
            guess as the upper limit of integration.</li>
          <li>Solve the Picard integral equation to obtain an improved approximation
            of the solution. This can be done analytically if the integral equation
            is solvable, or numerically using numerical integration techniques.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3, using the improved approximation as the new initial
            guess. Iterate this process until the solution converges to a desired level
            of accuracy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The convergence of Picard's method relies on the Lipschitz condition,
          which guarantees the uniqueness and existence of the solution. If the Lipschitz
          condition is satisfied, the method will converge to the true solution of
          the ODE.</p>
