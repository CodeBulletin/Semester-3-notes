       <h1>Euler&#39;s method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Euler's method is a simple and widely used numerical method for approximating
          the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is named after
          the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who introduced it in the 18th century.</p>
        <p>Euler's method is based on the idea of approximating the solution by taking
          small steps along the derivative of the function at each point. The method
          is derived from the first-order Taylor series expansion.</p>
        <p>Here's how Euler's method works:</p>
        <p>Start with an initial condition: a known value of the solution at a specific
          point, often denoted as "x₀" and "y₀" for the independent and dependent
          variables, respectively.</p>
        <p>Choose a step size, denoted as "h," which determines the distance between
          consecutive points in the approximation.</p>
        <p>Use the initial condition to calculate the derivative of the function
          at the starting point: "f(x₀, y₀)." This derivative represents the slope
          of the function at that point.</p>
        <p>Approximate the value of the solution at the next point, "x₁," by taking
          a step of size "h" in the direction of the derivative:</p>
        <p>y₁ = y₀ + h * f(x₀, y₀)</p>
        <p>This equation represents the Euler's method update formula.</p>
        <p>Repeat steps 3 and 4, using the newly approximated value as the initial
          condition, to calculate the solution at subsequent points. Continue this
          process until the desired range or number of points is reached.</p>
        <p>Euler's method is relatively straightforward to implement and computationally
          efficient. However, it is a first-order method, meaning that the error
          in the approximation tends to accumulate over time. As a result, it may
          not provide highly accurate solutions for complex ODEs or when a high level
          of precision is required.</p>
