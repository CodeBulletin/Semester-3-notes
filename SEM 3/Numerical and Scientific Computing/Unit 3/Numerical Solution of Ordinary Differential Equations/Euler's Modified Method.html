       <h1>Euler&#39;s Modified Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Euler's Modified Method, also known as the Improved Euler's Method or
          the Heun's Method, is a modification of the original Euler's method for
          approximating the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It
          is an explicit numerical method that provides a more accurate approximation
          by considering the average of the slopes at the current and next points.</p>
        <p>Here's how Euler's Modified Method works:</p>
        <p>Start with an initial condition: a known value of the solution at a specific
          point, often denoted as "x₀" and "y₀" for the independent and dependent
          variables, respectively.</p>
        <p>Choose a step size, denoted as "h," which determines the distance between
          consecutive points in the approximation.</p>
        <p>Use the initial condition to calculate the derivative of the function
          at the starting point: "f(x₀, y₀)." This derivative represents the slope
          of the function at that point.</p>
        <p>Approximate the value of the solution at an intermediate point, "x₀ +
          h/2," using Euler's method:</p>
        <p>y_intermediate = y₀ + (h/2) * f(x₀, y₀)</p>
        <p>Calculate the derivative of the function at the intermediate point: "f(x₀
          + h/2, y_intermediate)."</p>
        <p>Use the average of the slopes at the current and next points to update
          the approximation:</p>
        <p>y₁ = y₀ + h * f(x₀ + h/2, y_intermediate)</p>
        <p>This equation represents the Euler's Modified Method update formula.</p>
        <p>Repeat steps 4 to 6, using the newly approximated value as the initial
          condition, to calculate the solution at subsequent points. Continue this
          process until the desired range or number of points is reached.</p>
        <p>Euler's Modified Method improves upon the accuracy of the original Euler's
          method by considering the average slope over the interval between two points.
          This helps to reduce the error that accumulates in the approximation. However,
          it is still a first-order method and may not provide highly accurate solutions
          for complex ODEs or when a high level of precision is required.</p>
