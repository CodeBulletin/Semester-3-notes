       <h1>Runge-Kutta method order 4</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, often referred to as RK4, is a widely
          used numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
          It is known for its high accuracy and stability, making it one of the most
          popular choices for numerical ODE solving.</p>
        <p>Here's how the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method works:</p>
        <p>Start with an initial condition: a known value of the solution at a specific
          point, often denoted as "x₀" and "y₀" for the independent and dependent
          variables, respectively.</p>
        <p>Choose a step size, denoted as "h," which determines the distance between
          consecutive points in the approximation.</p>
        <p>Use the initial condition to calculate the derivative of the function
          at the starting point: "f(x₀, y₀)." This derivative represents the slope
          of the function at that point.</p>
        <p>Approximate the value of the solution at four intermediate points using
          weighted averages of the slopes:</p>
        <p>k₁ = h * f(x₀, y₀) k₂ = h * f(x₀ + h/2, y₀ + k₁/2) k₃ = h * f(x₀ + h/2,
          y₀ + k₂/2) k₄ = h * f(x₀ + h, y₀ + k₃)</p>
        <p>Here, k₁, k₂, k₃, and k₄ represent the slopes at different points.</p>
        <p>Use these intermediate slopes to update the approximation:</p>
        <p>y₁ = y₀ + (k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄)/6</p>
        <p>This equation represents the fourth-order Runge-Kutta update formula.</p>
        <p>Repeat steps 3 to 5, using the newly approximated value as the initial
          condition, to calculate the solution at subsequent points. Continue this
          process until the desired range or number of points is reached.</p>
        <p>The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method provides a highly accurate approximation
          of the solution by considering the weighted averages of the slopes at multiple
          points within each step. It has a truncation error of O(h^4), meaning that
          the error decreases rapidly as the step size is reduced.</p>
