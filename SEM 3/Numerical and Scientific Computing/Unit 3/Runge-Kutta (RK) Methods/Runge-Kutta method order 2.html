       <h1>Runge-Kutta method order 2</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Runge-Kutta method is known for its accuracy and versatility, and
          there are various orders of Runge-Kutta methods available. The second-order
          Runge-Kutta method, often referred to as RK2 or the midpoint method, is
          one of the simplest and most commonly used variants.</p>
        <p>Here's how the second-order Runge-Kutta method works:</p>
        <p>Start with an initial condition: a known value of the solution at a specific
          point, often denoted as "x₀" and "y₀" for the independent and dependent
          variables, respectively.</p>
        <p>Choose a step size, denoted as "h," which determines the distance between
          consecutive points in the approximation.</p>
        <p>Use the initial condition to calculate the derivative of the function
          at the starting point: "f(x₀, y₀)." This derivative represents the slope
          of the function at that point.</p>
        <p>Approximate the value of the solution at the midpoint of the interval
          using Euler's method:</p>
        <p>y_midpoint = y₀ + (h/2) * f(x₀, y₀)</p>
        <p>Calculate the derivative of the function at the midpoint: "f(x₀ + h/2,
          y_midpoint)."</p>
        <p>Use the derivative at the midpoint to update the approximation:</p>
        <p>y₁ = y₀ + h * f(x₀ + h/2, y_midpoint)</p>
        <p>This equation represents the second-order Runge-Kutta update formula.</p>
        <p>Repeat steps 3 to 6, using the newly approximated value as the initial
          condition, to calculate the solution at subsequent points. Continue this
          process until the desired range or number of points is reached.</p>
        <p>The second-order Runge-Kutta method provides a more accurate approximation
          compared to Euler's method by considering the slope at the midpoint of
          the interval. However, it is still a second-order method, meaning that
          the error in the approximation decreases quadratically with the step size.
          For even higher accuracy, higher-order Runge-Kutta methods like RK4 can
          be used.</p>
