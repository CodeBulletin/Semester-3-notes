        <p>The Taylor series theorem provides a way to approximate a sufficiently
          smooth function \( f(x) \) near a point \( a \) by a polynomial constructed
          from the derivatives of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span>&nbsp;at&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>. Here's a derivation and explanation of the Taylor series:</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Function and Its Derivatives</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>Consider a function&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x)\)</span>&nbsp;that
          has&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;continuous derivatives
          on an interval containing&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Taylor Series Expansion</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>The Taylor series of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span>&nbsp;around&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;is given by:</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n + R_n(x)\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f^{(n)}(a)\)</span>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(n^{\th}\)</span>&nbsp;derivative of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span>&nbsp;evaluated
            at&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(R_n(x)\)</span>&nbsp;is
            the remainder term, representing the error in the approximation.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Derivation of the Formula</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>1. <strong>Start with&nbsp;</strong><span class="math-tex">\(n=0\)</span>:
          The simplest case,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x) \approx f(a)\)</span>,
          is a constant approximation (zeroth derivative).</p>
        <p>2. <strong>First Derivative (Linear approximation)</strong>: Consider the
          tangent line to&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span>&nbsp;at&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>. The equation of the tangent line is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)\)</span>.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Higher Derivatives</strong>: To improve the approximation, include
          terms involving higher derivatives. By considering the rate of change of
          the function and its derivatives at&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>,
          we construct the polynomial approximation.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>General Term</strong>: The general term of the Taylor series
          is derived from the&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n^{\th}\)</span>&nbsp;derivative
          of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>,
          leading to the term&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n \)</span>.</p>
        <p>5. <strong>Infinite Series</strong>: By extending this process to an infinite
          number of derivatives, we get the full Taylor series.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Remainder Term (Error)</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>The remainder term&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(R_n(x)\)</span>&nbsp;in
          the Taylor series is crucial for understanding the accuracy of the approximation.
          One common form of the remainder term is given by the Lagrange form:</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x - a)^{(n+1)}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>for some&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\xi\)</span>&nbsp;between&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>. This term
            gives the error between the actual value of the function and its Taylor
            approximation up to the&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n^{\th}\)</span>&nbsp;term.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>The Taylor series provides a powerful tool in analysis and applied mathematics
          for approximating functions using polynomials. It is especially useful
          when dealing with complex functions where direct evaluation is difficult.
          The series shows how a function can be expressed as an infinite sum of
          terms calculated from its derivatives at a single point.</p>
