        <h2>(a) Explain Boole's Rule and Weddle's Rule With the help of mathematical formulation</h2>
        <p>Boole's Rule and Weddle's Rule are both methods for numerical integration,
          used to approximate the definite integral of a function. They are particularly
          useful when dealing with integrals that are difficult or impossible to
          solve analytically. Let's discuss each rule with its mathematical formulation:</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Boole's Rule</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>Boole's Rule is an extension of Simpson's rule for numerical integration.
          It is a Newton-Cotes formula for approximating integrals using polynomial
          interpolation. Specifically, it uses fourth-degree polynomials (quartic
          polynomials).</p>
        <p>Given a function&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x)\)</span>&nbsp;and
          an interval&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((a, b)\)</span>&nbsp;divided
          into four equal subintervals, with points&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\)</span>,
          the integral of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span>&nbsp;from&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(a \space to \space b\)</span>&nbsp;is approximately:</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{2h}{45} \left[ 7f(x_0) + 32f(x_1) + 12f(x_2) + 32f(x_3) + 7f(x_4) \right]\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(h = \frac{b - a}{4} \)</span>&nbsp;is
          the width of each subinterval.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Weddle's Rule</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>Weddle's Rule is another method for numerical integration, less commonly
          used than Boole's Rule but useful in specific contexts. It is an application
          of Newton-Cotes formulas for a seven-point interpolation.</p>
        <p>Given a function \( f(x) \) and an interval \([a, b]\) divided into six
          equal subintervals, with points&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\)</span>,
          the integral of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f\)</span>&nbsp;from&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(a \space to \space b\)</span>is approximately:</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{3h}{10} \left[ f(x_0) + 5f(x_1) + f(x_2) + 6f(x_3) + f(x_4) + 5f(x_5) + f(x_6) \right]\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(h = \frac{b - a}{6}\)</span>&nbsp;is
          the width of each subinterval.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Usage and Accuracy</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>Both rules are examples of closed Newton-Cotes formulas, where the endpoints
          of the intervals are used in the approximation. They are more accurate
          than lower-degree methods like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule for
          smooth functions but require more function evaluations. These rules are
          especially useful when high accuracy is needed without resorting to very
          small subinterval sizes. However, like all numerical integration techniques,
          their accuracy decreases when applied to functions that are not well-behaved
          or have significant curvature over the interval.</p>
