        <h2>(a) Illustrate with example the errors such as absolute, relative, truncation, rounding off</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Absolute Error</strong>:
            <br>The absolute error is the difference between the measured or calculated
            value and the true or expected value. It gives you an idea of how far off
            your estimation is from the actual value, without considering the scale
            or magnitude of the values involved.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x = 1.27195\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{x} = 1.273\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_a = |x - \bar{x}| = 0.00105\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Relative Error</strong>:
            <br>The relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the true value.
            It's often expressed as a percentage. Relative error provides a way to
            compare the error to the size of the actual value, giving you a sense of
            the proportion of error.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_r = \frac{E_a}{x}\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_r = 0.00082550414\)</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Truncation Error</strong>:&nbsp;
            <br>In numerical analysis and scientific computing, truncation error is an
            error caused by approximating a mathematical process. Truncation error
            results from ignoring all but a finite number of terms of an infinite series.
            For example, the exponential function ex may be expressed as the sum of
            the infinite series.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + ...\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{e^x} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(T_r = \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^6}{6!} + ...\)</span>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(e^1 = 2.71828182846\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{e^1} = 2.66666666667\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(err = |e^1 - \bar{e^1}| = 0.05161516178\)</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Round Off Error</strong>:
            <br>Round-off error occurs when real numbers are approximated using a finite
            number of digits or bits. It's the discrepancy between the true value and
            the rounded value. This error accumulates in calculations, and it's a type
            of error caused by representing continuous values with discrete approximations.
            <br><strong>Example</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x = 1.2775495\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{x} = 1.278\)</span>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(R = |x - \bar{x}| = 0.0004505\)</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) explain pitfalls of floating point representation</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Precision Loss:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Floating-point numbers have a limited precision. Operations on floating-point
            numbers may lead to rounding errors, which can accumulate and result in
            a loss of precision over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Representation Errors:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some decimal numbers cannot be precisely represented in binary floating-point
            format. For example, the decimal fraction 0.1 cannot be exactly represented
            in binary, leading to rounding errors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Finite Precision:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computers have a finite amount of memory to store floating-point numbers.
            This finite precision can lead to underflow (very small numbers close to
            zero may be represented as zero) or overflow (very large numbers may be
            represented as infinity).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparisons and Equality Testing:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Due to rounding errors, comparing two floating-point numbers for equality
            can be tricky. It's often recommended to use a tolerance level when comparing
            floating-point numbers instead of checking for exact equality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Order of Operations Matters:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The order in which operations are performed can affect the result due
            to rounding errors. Reordering operations can lead to different results,
            especially when dealing with numbers of different magnitudes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Loss of Significance:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Subtraction of two nearly equal numbers can result in a significant loss
            of precision, a phenomenon known as "catastrophic cancellation."</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Denormalized Numbers:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Numbers close to zero may be represented with reduced precision or as
            denormalized numbers. Operations involving denormalized numbers can be
            slower, leading to performance issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Inexact Representations:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some simple decimal fractions, such as 1/3, cannot be represented exactly
            in floating-point format. This can lead to unexpected results in calculations
            involving such numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Portability Issues:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Different computer architectures and programming languages may implement
            floating-point arithmetic differently, leading to portability issues when
            code is moved between systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Complexity for Human Understanding:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Floating-point representation can be challenging for humans to understand
            intuitively, leading to mistakes in code or misinterpretation of results.</li>
        </ul>
