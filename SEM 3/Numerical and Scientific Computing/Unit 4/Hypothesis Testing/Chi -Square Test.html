       <h1>Chi -Square Test</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>The chi-square test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether
          there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It
          is a non-parametric test, meaning it makes no assumptions about the distribution
          of the data. The test is particularly useful when working with nominal
          data, where the variables are categories that cannot be ordered.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">There are different types of chi-square tests, but the two most common
          ones are:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Chi-square test for independence:</strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">This test is used to determine whether there is a significant association
            between two categorical variables. The null hypothesis (<span class="math-tex">\(H_0\)</span>​)
            assumes that the variables are independent.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The test involves comparing the observed frequencies in a contingency
            table with the frequencies that would be expected if the variables were
            independent.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The formula for the chi-square test statistic is:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(\chi^2 = \sum \frac{Oi-E_i}{E_i}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="math-tex">\(\chi^2\)</span>&nbsp;is the chi-square test statistic.</li>
            <li><span class="math-tex">\(O_i\)</span>​ is the observed frequency in each
              category.</li>
            <li><span class="math-tex">\(E_i\)</span>&nbsp;is the expected frequency in
              each category under the assumption of independence.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The test compares the observed and expected frequencies to determine if
            there is a significant difference.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Chi-square goodness-of-fit test:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>This test is used when you have one categorical variable and you want
              to test whether the distribution of observed categorical data matches an
              expected distribution.</li>
            <li>The null hypothesis (<span class="math-tex">\(H_0\)</span>​) assumes that
              there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.</li>
            <li>The test involves comparing the observed frequencies with the expected
              frequencies, and the formula for the chi-square test statistic is similar
              to the one used in the test for independence.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The results of the chi-square test are typically compared to a critical
            value or a p-value. If the calculated chi-square statistic is greater than
            the critical value or if the p-value is less than the chosen significance
            level, the null hypothesis is rejected, suggesting a significant association
            between the variables or a significant difference between the observed
            and expected distributions.</p>
