        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Type I Error (False Positive):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Type I error occurs when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis.
            In other words, you conclude that there is a significant effect or difference
            when, in reality, there is none.</li>
          <li>The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by the level of significance,
            �<i>α</i>.</li>
          <li>Example: Suppose you are testing a new drug, and the null hypothesis is
            that the drug has no effect. If you observe a significant result and conclude
            that the drug is effective when, in fact, it is not, you've committed a
            Type I error.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Type II Error (False Negative):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Type II error occurs when you incorrectly fail to reject a false null
            hypothesis. In other words, you conclude that there is no significant effect
            or difference when, in reality, there is one.</li>
          <li>The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by the symbol �<i>β</i>.</li>
          <li>Example: Using the same drug example, let's say the drug does have a real
            effect, but your study fails to detect it. You would then incorrectly conclude
            that the drug is not effective, committing a Type II error.</li>
