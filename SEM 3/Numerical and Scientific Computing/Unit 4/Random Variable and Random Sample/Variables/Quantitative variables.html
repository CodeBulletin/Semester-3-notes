       <h1>Quantitative variables</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Quantitative variables, also known as numerical variables, are variables
          that represent quantifiable quantitiesâ€”meaning they are measured in numbers
          and can be used in arithmetic operations. These variables are essential
          in statistical analysis and scientific research because they provide a
          means for measuring, calculating, and comparing quantities. Quantitative
          variables are generally divided into two categories:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Continuous Variables:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Continuous variables can take on any value within a given range. The range
            might be finite or infinite.</li>
          <li>They are not restricted to discrete, separate values, but rather can occupy
            any value on a continuum within a range.</li>
          <li>Examples include:
            <ul>
              <li>Height: People can be 170.5 cm, 170.51 cm, 170.52 cm, etc.</li>
              <li>Time: It can be measured to any level of precision, like seconds, milliseconds,
                or even smaller units.</li>
              <li>Temperature: It can vary continuously and can be measured to several decimal
                places.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Continuous variables are often measured, rather than counted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Discrete Variables:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discrete variables consist of countable values. They can take on a finite
            or countably infinite number of values.</li>
          <li>These values are distinct and separate, which means the variable cannot
            take on values between these distinct points.</li>
          <li>Examples include:
            <ul>
              <li>Number of children in a family: You can have 1, 2, 3 children, etc., but
                not 2.5 children.</li>
              <li>Number of cars in a parking lot.</li>
              <li>Number of questions answered correctly on a test.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Discrete variables are typically counted, not measured.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Quantitative variables are fundamental in various types of statistical
          analyses. They allow for a range of mathematical and statistical operations,
          including calculating averages, variances, and correlations. They are used
          to perform various types of statistical tests and are key in the creation
          of graphs and charts like histograms, scatter plots, and line graphs.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">In research and data analysis, understanding whether a variable is discrete
          or continuous helps determine the appropriate analytical approach and the
          type of statistical tests that can be applied. For example, certain parametric
          tests are suitable for continuous data, while non-parametric tests may
          be more appropriate for discrete data.</p>
