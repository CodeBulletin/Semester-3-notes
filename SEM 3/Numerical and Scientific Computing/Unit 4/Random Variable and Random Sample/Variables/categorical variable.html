       <h1>categorical variable</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A categorical variable, also known as a qualitative variable, is a type
          of variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number
          of possible values, assigning each individual or other unit of observation
          to a particular group or nominal category on the basis of some qualitative
          property. In contrast to numeric variables (like height or age), categorical
          variables are often non-numerical or have numerical values that donâ€™t have
          a mathematical meaning.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Categorical variables are commonly divided into two types:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Nominal Variables:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These variables have two or more categories without any kind of order
            or priority.</li>
          <li>Examples include gender (male, female), blood type (A, B, AB, O), and
            marital status (single, married, divorced, widowed).</li>
          <li>The categories are distinct and there is no inherent order to the categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Ordinal Variables:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These variables have two or more categories just like nominal variables
            but the categories have an inherent order.</li>
          <li>An example is a rating scale of 1 to 5 that measures satisfaction or pain,
            where each number corresponds to a level of satisfaction or pain intensity.</li>
          <li>The order of the categories is meaningful, but the differences between
            the categories are not necessarily uniform (i.e., the difference between
            categories 1 and 2 may not be the same as between categories 3 and 4).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In data analysis, it's important to identify categorical variables because
          they require different handling than numeric variables. For example, most
          statistical models require that categorical variables be encoded in a way
          that is suitable for the model. This often involves creating dummy variables
          or using techniques like one-hot encoding to transform the categories into
          a format that can be used in mathematical calculations.</p>
