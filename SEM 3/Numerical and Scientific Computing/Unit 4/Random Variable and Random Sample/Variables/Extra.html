        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In an experimental or observational study, these are the outcomes or results
            that are being measured. They are thought to depend on or be influenced
            by another variable (the independent variable).</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These are the variables that are manipulated or varied in an experiment
            to see how they affect the dependent variable. In observational studies,
            they are the variables that are believed to influence or predict the outcome.</li>

        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Control Variables:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables that are kept constant or unchanged during an experiment to
            ensure that the effect on the dependent variable is due to the independent
            variable alone.</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables that are not of interest in the study but could affect the results,
            leading to incorrect conclusions if not accounted for.</li>
