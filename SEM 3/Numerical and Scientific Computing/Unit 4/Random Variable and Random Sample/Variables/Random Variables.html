       <h1>Random Variables</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Random variables are a fundamental concept in statistics and probability
          theory. They are used to quantify the outcomes of random phenomena. There
          are two main types of random variables:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Discrete Random Variables</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>These are variables that can take on a countable number of distinct values.</li>
          <li>Common examples include the roll of a die (which can result in 1, 2, 3,
            4, 5, or 6), the number of heads in a series of coin tosses, or the number
            of students present in a classroom.</li>
          <li>The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is often represented
            by a probability mass function (PMF), which gives the probability of each
            possible value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Continuous Random Variables</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>These variables can take on an infinite number of possible values, often
            within a certain range.</li>
          <li>Examples include the measurement of time it takes for something to happen,
            the height of students in a school, or the temperature on a given day.</li>
          <li>The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is described
            by a probability density function (PDF), which describes the relative likelihood
            of any outcome within a range of values.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Each type of random variable has its own methods and formulas for calculating
          probabilities and expectations, reflecting the different nature of discrete
          and continuous outcomes.</p>
