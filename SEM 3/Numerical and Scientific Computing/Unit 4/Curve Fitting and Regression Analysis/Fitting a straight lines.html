       <h1>Fitting a straight lines</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Fitting a straight line to a set of data points, also known as linear
          regression, is a common application of the method of least squares. The
          general form of a straight line equation is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(y=mx+b\)</span>,
          where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>&nbsp;is the dependent variable (the
            variable you want to predict),</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is the independent variable (the
            variable used for prediction),</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;is the slope of the line, and</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;is the y-intercept (the value
            of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is
            zero).</li>
