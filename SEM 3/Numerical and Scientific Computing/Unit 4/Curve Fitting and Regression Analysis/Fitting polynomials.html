       <h1>Fitting polynomials</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Fitting polynomials refers to the process of finding a polynomial function
          that closely approximates a given set of data points. This is often done
          through a mathematical technique called polynomial regression. Polynomial
          regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between
          the independent variable (input) and the dependent variable (output) is
          modeled as an nth degree polynomial.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The general form of an nth degree polynomial is given by:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(P(x) = a_0 +a_1x +a_2x^2+a_3x^3+...+a_nx^n\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(P(x)\)</span>&nbsp;is the polynomial
          function,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is the independent
          variable, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\)</span>
          <span
          style="color:var(--text-primary);">â€‹</span>are the coefficients that need to be determined to fit the polynomial
            to the data.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The process of fitting a polynomial involves adjusting the coefficients
          to minimize the difference between the predicted values of the polynomial
          and the actual data points. This is typically done using optimization techniques
          such as least squares regression, where the sum of the squared differences
          between the predicted and actual values is minimized.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">It's important to note that while polynomial regression can be a powerful
          tool for modeling relationships in data, higher-degree polynomials may
          lead to overfitting, capturing noise in the data rather than the underlying
          trend. Therefore, the choice of the degree of the polynomial should be
          carefully considered based on the characteristics of the data.</p>
