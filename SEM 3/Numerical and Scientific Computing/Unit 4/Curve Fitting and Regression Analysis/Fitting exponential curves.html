       <h1>Fitting exponential curves</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Fitting exponential curves involves finding the best-fitting exponential
          function to a given set of data points. Exponential functions have the
          general form:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(f(x) = ae^{bx}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x)\)</span>&nbsp;is the dependent
          variable,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is the independent
          variable,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;is a constant coefficient,
          and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;is the exponential growth
          or decay rate.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The process of fitting exponential curves typically involves determining
          the values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;that minimize the difference between the predicted values
            of the exponential function and the actual data points. This is often done
            through optimization techniques, such as least squares regression.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The steps for fitting exponential curves are as follows:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Choose the appropriate form of the exponential
            function based on the characteristics of the data. For example, if the
            data exhibit exponential growth, use&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x) = ae^{bx}\)</span>;
            if it shows exponential decay, use&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(x)=ae^{-bx}\)</span>.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Optimization:</strong> Use an optimization algorithm, often least
            squares regression, to find the values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;that minimize the sum of the squared differences between
              the predicted and actual values. This involves adjusting the parameters
              to maximize the likelihood of the model given the data.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Evaluate the goodness of fit using appropriate
                metrics, such as the coefficient of determination (<span class="math-tex">\(R^2\)</span>),
                to assess how well the exponential curve represents the data.</p>
