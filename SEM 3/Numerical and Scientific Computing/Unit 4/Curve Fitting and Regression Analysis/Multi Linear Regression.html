       <h1>Multi Linear Regression</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression that involves
          modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more
          independent variables. In other words, it allows for the consideration
          of multiple predictors in predicting an outcome. The general form of a
          multiple regression model with&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;independent
          variables (predictors) can be expressed as:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(Y = ε + b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_kx_k\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(Y\)</span>&nbsp;is the dependent variable.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(b_0\)</span>​ is the y-intercept.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(b_1, b_2, ..., b_k\)</span>​ are the coefficients
            associated with the independent variables&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_1,x_2, ...,x_k\)</span>​,
            respectively.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(ε\)</span>&nbsp;is the error term, representing
            unobserved factors that affect&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(Y\)</span>&nbsp;but
            are not included in the model.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The goal of multiple regression is to estimate the coefficients (
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(b_1, b_2, ..., b_k\)</span>) that best fit the data. This is typically
            done using the method of least squares, where the sum of the squared differences
            between the observed and predicted values is minimized.</p>
