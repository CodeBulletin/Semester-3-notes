       <h1>Random Sampling</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Random sampling is a method of selecting a subset of individuals or items
          from a larger population in a way that each member of the population has
          an equal chance of being chosen. The process is designed to ensure that
          the sample is representative of the entire population, making it more likely
          that the findings from the sample can be generalized to the population
          as a whole.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here are some key points about random sampling:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Equal Probability:</strong> In random sampling, every individual
          or item in the population has an equal probability of being selected for
          the sample. This ensures that the sample is not biased toward any specific
          subgroup within the population.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Randomization Techniques:</strong> Random sampling is often achieved
          using randomization techniques, such as random number generators or random
          selection methods, to eliminate any systematic patterns or biases in the
          selection process.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Representativeness:</strong> The goal of random sampling is to
          obtain a representative sample that accurately reflects the characteristics
          of the entire population. This helps in making statistical inferences and
          drawing conclusions about the population based on the sample data.</p>

        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Types of Random Sampling:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple Random Sampling:</strong> Individuals or items are chosen
              randomly without any specific pattern or method.</li>
            <li><strong>Stratified Random Sampling:</strong> The population is divided
              into subgroups (strata), and random samples are then taken from each subgroup.</li>
            <li><strong>Systematic Random Sampling:</strong> A random starting point is
              selected, and then every ï¿½<i>k</i>-th element is included in the sample.</li>
