       <h1>Linear and Non-Linear Regression</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Linear Regression:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Model Form:</strong> In linear regression, the relationship between
            the dependent variable&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>&nbsp;and
            the independent variable(s)&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is
            assumed to be linear. The general form of a linear regression model with
            one independent variable is:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(y = mx+b\)</span>&nbsp;Here,&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;is the slope, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;is
              the y-intercept. In the case of multiple independent variables, the equation
              becomes a linear combination of these variables.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of linear regression is to find the
            best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between
            the observed and predicted values.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Optimization:</strong> This is often achieved through the method
            of least squares, where the sum of the squared differences between the
            observed and predicted values is minimized.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting house prices based on square footage,
            number of bedrooms, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Non-linear Regression:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Model Form:</strong> In non-linear regression, the relationship
            between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s) is modeled
            using a non-linear function. The functional form can take various shapes,
            such as exponential, logarithmic, power-law, or other non-linear forms.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective is the same as in linear regressionâ€”to
            find the parameters that minimize the difference between the observed and
            predicted values. However, the function is non-linear.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Optimization:</strong> Optimization techniques, such as gradient
              descent or nonlinear least squares, are commonly used to find the best-fitting
              parameters for the non-linear function.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example:</strong> Modeling population growth using an exponential
              function or modeling enzyme kinetics using the Michaelis-Menten equation.</li>
