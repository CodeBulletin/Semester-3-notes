       <h1>Smoothing of curves</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Smoothing of curves refers to the process of reducing the noise or variability
          in a dataset to reveal the underlying trend or pattern. This is commonly
          done in data analysis and visualization to make patterns more apparent
          and to simplify the interpretation of the data. Smoothing is often applied
          to curves or time series data to highlight long-term trends while minimizing
          the impact of short-term fluctuations.</p>
        <p>There are various methods for smoothing curves, and the choice of method
          depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of analysis. Here
          are a few common smoothing techniques:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Moving Average</strong>: This involves calculating the average
            of a set of data points within a moving window. Each data point in the
            smoothed curve is the average of the values within its window. This is
            effective in reducing noise and emphasizing trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Loess (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing)</strong>: Loess
            is a non-parametric regression method that fits a curve to the data based
            on locally weighted linear regression. It assigns different weights to
            data points based on their proximity to the point where the curve is being
            estimated. This allows the method to capture both local and global trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Exponential Smoothing</strong>: Exponential smoothing assigns
            exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. It is often used
            in time series analysis to give more importance to recent data points while
            still considering older observations.</li>
          <li><strong>Spline Interpolation</strong>: Splines are smooth curves that
            interpolate between data points. Cubic splines, in particular, are commonly
            used for smoothing. They involve fitting a cubic polynomial between each
            pair of adjacent data points, ensuring smoothness at the connection points.</li>
          <li><strong>Kernel Smoothing</strong>: Kernel smoothing, also known as kernel
            density estimation, involves placing a kernel (a smoothing function) at
            each data point and summing them to estimate a smooth curve. This method
            is often used for estimating probability density functions.</li>
