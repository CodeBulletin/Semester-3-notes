       <h1>Moving Average</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Moving Average (MA)</strong> is a statistical calculation used
          to analyze data over a certain time period. It is often employed in time
          series analysis to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term
          trends or cycles. The basic idea is to calculate the average of a set of
          data points within a moving window that shifts through the data.</p>

        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Types of Moving Averages</strong>
          </h2>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Simple Moving Average</strong></h3>
          <p>a simple moving average (<span class="math-tex">\(SMA\)</span>) is the
            unweighted mean of the previous&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;data-points</p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(SMA_k = \frac{p_{n-k+1} +p_{n-k+2}+...+p_n}{k}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(SMA_{k, next} = SMA_{k, prev} + \frac{1}{k}(p_{n+1}-p_{n-k+1})\)</span>
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Cumulative Average</strong></h3>
          <p>In a cumulative average (<span class="math-tex">\(CA\)</span>), the data
            arrive in an ordered datum stream, and the user would like to get the average
            of all of the data up until the current datum. For example, an investor
            may want the average price of all of the stock transactions for a particular
            stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs, the average
            price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions
            up&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(CA_n = \frac{p_1+p_2+...+p_n}{n}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(CA_{n+1} = CA_n + \frac{x_{n+1} - CA_n}{n+1}\)</span>
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Weighted moving average</strong></h3>
          <p>A weighted average is an average that has multiplying factors to give
            different weights to data at different positions in the sample window.
            Mathematically, the weighted moving average is the convolution of the data
            with a fixed weighting function. One application is removing pixelization
            from a digital graphical image</p>
          <p>In an&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>-day&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(WMA\)</span>&nbsp;the
            latest day has weight&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>, the second
            latest&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n-1\)</span>, etc., down to one</p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(WMA_M = \frac{np_M + (n-1)p_{M-1} + {n-2}p_{M-2} + ... 2p_{M-n+2} +p_{M-n+1}}{n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(\)</span><span class="math-tex">\(T_{M+1} = T_M + p_{M+1}-P_{M-n+1}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(N_{M+1} = N_M + np_{M+1} -T_M\)</span>
          </p>
          <p><span class="math-tex">\(WMA_{M+1} = \frac{T_{M+1}}{n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1}\)</span>
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Exponential moving average</strong></h3>
          <p>Exponential smoothing or exponential moving average (<span class="math-tex">\(EMA\)</span>)
            is a rule of thumb technique for smoothing time series data using the exponential
            window function. Whereas in the simple moving average the past observations
            are weighted equally, exponential functions are used to assign exponentially
            decreasing weights over time. It is an easily learned and easily applied
            procedure for making some determination based on prior assumptions by the
            user, such as seasonality. Exponential smoothing is often used for analysis
            of time-series data.</p>

          <p><span class="math-tex">\(s_t = \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha)s_{t-1}, \space t &gt; 0\)</span>
          </p>
          <p>where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\alpha\)</span>&nbsp;is the smoothing
            factor,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)</span>
