       <h1>Method of least squares</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The method of least squares is a mathematical approach used in regression
          analysis and curve fitting to find the best-fitting line (or curve) through
          a set of data points. The goal is to minimize the sum of the squares of
          the vertical distances (residuals) between the observed data points and
          the points predicted by the model.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a simplified explanation of how the method of least squares works,
          focusing on linear regression:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Define the Model:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In linear regression, the model is typically represented as a straight
            line:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(y = mx + b\)</span>, where&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>&nbsp;is the dependent variable,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is
              the independent variable,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;is
              the slope of the line, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;is
              the y-intercept.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Calculate Residuals:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each data point, calculate the vertical distance (residual) between
            the observed&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>-value and the&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>-value predicted by the model. The residual is the difference
              between the observed and predicted values.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Square the Residuals:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Square each of the residuals obtained in step 2. Squaring is done to ensure
            that the positive and negative residuals do not cancel each other out when
            summing them up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Find the values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;that minimize the sum of the squared residuals. This
              is often done by taking the partial derivatives of the sum of squared residuals
              with respect to&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
              <span
              class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>, setting them equal to zero, and solving the resulting system
                of equations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Coefficients and Best-Fitting Line:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;obtained in step 4 are the coefficients of the best-fitting
              line. This line represents the relationship between the variables that
              minimizes the overall squared differences between observed and predicted
              values.</li>
        </ul>
