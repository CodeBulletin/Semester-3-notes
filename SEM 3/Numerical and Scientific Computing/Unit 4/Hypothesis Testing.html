       <h1>Hypothesis Testing</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about
          population parameters based on a sample of data. It involves formulating
          a hypothesis about the population parameter, collecting data, and then
          using statistical techniques to determine whether the observed data provides
          enough evidence to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The process typically involves the following steps:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Formulate Hypotheses:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0):</strong> This is a statement of no effect
              or no difference. It represents the status quo or a default assumption.
              It is denoted by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(H_0\)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha):</strong> This is a statement
              that contradicts the null hypothesis and represents the effect or difference
              you are trying to detect. It is denoted by ï¿½<span class="math-tex">\(H_1\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;
              <span
              class="math-tex">\(H_a\)</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Collect Data:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gather relevant data through observations, experiments, or surveys.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Choose Significance Level:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>This is denoted by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\alpha\)</span>&nbsp;and
              represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is
              true. Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Perform Statistical Test:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use an appropriate statistical test based on the nature of the data and
              the hypothesis being tested. Common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests,
              ANOVA, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Make a Decision:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Based on the calculated test statistic and the significance level, decide
              whether to reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Draw Conclusion:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the p-value (probability value) is less than the significance level,
              reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than or equal to
              the significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
          </ul>
