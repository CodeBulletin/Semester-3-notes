       <h1>Proportions</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Proportions are a statistical measure that reflects the fraction or percentage
          of a whole. They are often used to describe the relative frequency of a
          particular outcome within a dataset or population. Here's a breakdown of
          what proportions represent:</p>
        <p><strong>Fraction of a Whole</strong>: A proportion indicates what part
          of a total a particular subset represents. For example, if you have 20
          apples, and 5 of them are green, the proportion of green apples is 520=0.25205â€‹=0.25,
          or 25%.</p>
        <p><strong>Used in Various Fields</strong>: Proportions are widely used in
          fields like statistics, business, healthcare, and social sciences. For
          instance, in a survey, the proportion of respondents favoring a particular
          option gives insight into the general opinion.</p>
        <p><strong>Percentage Form</strong>: Often expressed as percentages, proportions
          are multiplied by 100. So, a proportion of 0.25 is equivalent to 25%.</p>
        <p><strong>Basis for Statistical Analysis</strong>: In statistics, proportions
          are crucial in areas like probability, where they can represent the likelihood
          of certain events, and in inferential statistics, where they can be used
          to make generalizations about a population based on sample data.</p>
        <p><strong>Comparison</strong>: Proportions allow for the comparison of different
          groups within a dataset. For example, comparing the proportion of men and
          women in a survey can reveal gender distribution in the sample.</p>
