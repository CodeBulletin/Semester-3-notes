       <h1>Mean</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The mean, often referred to as the average, is a measure of central tendency
          in statistics. It's calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset
          and then dividing by the number of values. The mean provides a quick and
          simple summary of a set of numerical data. For example, if you have a set
          of numbers like 3, 5, 7, the mean is calculated as (3 + 5 + 7) / 3 = 5.
          The mean is widely used in various fields for its simplicity and ability
          to give a basic overall picture of a dataset's characteristics, but it
          can be sensitive to extreme values or outliers.</p>
