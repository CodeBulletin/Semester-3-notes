      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>A sampling distribution is a statistical concept that describes the distribution
          of sample statistics, such as means or proportions, obtained from a large
          number of samples drawn from the same population. Essentially, it represents
          the range and frequency of possible values that a sample statistic (like
          the sample mean) can take, assuming you repeatedly sample from the same
          population.</p>
