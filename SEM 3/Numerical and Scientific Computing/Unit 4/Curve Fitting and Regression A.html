       <h1>Curve Fitting and Regression Analysis</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Curve Fitting:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Curve fitting is the process of constructing
            a curve (mathematical function) that best represents a series of data points.
            The goal is to find a function that closely matches the observed data,
            allowing for the prediction of values within the range of the data set.</li>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Curve fitting is often used to identify trends,
            patterns, or relationships between variables. It helps in understanding
            the general behavior of the data and making predictions beyond the observed
            data points.</li>
          <li><strong>Methods:</strong> There are various methods for curve fitting,
            including linear regression, polynomial regression, exponential regression,
            and more. The choice of method depends on the nature of the data and the
            expected relationship between variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Regression analysis is a statistical technique
            that examines the relationship between one or more independent variables
            and a dependent variable. The goal is to model this relationship and use
            the model for prediction, hypothesis testing, and understanding the strength
            and nature of the relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Regression analysis is used for predicting the
            value of the dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent
            variables. It also helps in understanding the impact of each independent
            variable on the dependent variable and assessing the overall goodness-of-fit
            of the model.</li>
          <li><strong>Types of Regression:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Assumes a linear relationship between
                variables.</li>
              <li><strong>Polynomial Regression:</strong> Allows for non-linear relationships
                by using polynomial functions.</li>
              <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Used for binary outcomes, where the
                dependent variable is categorical.</li>
              <li><strong>Multiple Regression:</strong> Deals with more than one independent
                variable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Both curve fitting and regression analysis involve finding the best-fitting
          model for the data, and they share many similarities. In fact, linear regression
          is a specific type of curve fitting where a linear equation is used to
          model the data. The key is to choose a model that accurately represents
          the relationship between variables and provides meaningful insights or
          predictions.</p>
