       <h1>Basics of Data Analytics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and
          interpreting large data sets to discover insights, patterns, and trends.
          It uses techniques and tools to extract information for informed decisions,
          problem-solving, and understanding subjects.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are four main types:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Descriptive Analytics:</strong> Summarizes historical data to understand
            past events, focusing on visualizations and reports.</li>
          <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Uses historical data to predict
            future trends using machine learning, statistical modeling, and data mining.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnostic Analysis:</strong> Investigates why specific events
            occurred, examining underlying causes and relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Prescriptive Analytics:</strong> Goes beyond prediction to suggest
            actions for desired outcomes, using optimization and simulation techniques.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics involves several stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering data from various sources,
            including structured and unstructured data.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Preparation:</strong> Refining and structuring
            the data, handling inconsistencies.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Applying techniques to explore data, identify
            patterns and trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Interpretation:</strong> Drawing insights from analysis results.</li>
          <li><strong>Presentation and Visualization:</strong> Communicating insights
            through visual formats for non-technical stakeholders.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Informing business strategies and problem-solving
            with insights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics is vital across industries like business, healthcare, and
          finance, helping in optimizing operations, customer experiences, market
          opportunities, risk mitigation, and performance enhancement. Technological
          advancements, particularly in machine learning and big data processing,
          continue to expand its capabilities.</p>
