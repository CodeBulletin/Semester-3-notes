       <h1>Basics of Data Analytics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics refers to the process of examining, cleaning, transforming,
          and interpreting large sets of data in order to uncover meaningful insights,
          patterns, and trends. It involves using various techniques, tools, and
          methodologies to extract valuable information from data that can aid in
          making informed business decisions, solving complex problems, and improving
          overall understanding of a particular subject.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics can be broadly categorized into four main types</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Descriptive Analytics</strong>: This type of analytics involves
            summarizing historical data to gain an understanding of what has happened
            in the past. It helps in answering questions like "What happened?" and
            "Why did it happen?" Descriptive analytics focuses on creating visualizations,
            reports, and dashboards to present data in a comprehensible format.</li>
          <li><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>: Predictive analytics involves using
            historical data to build models that can predict future outcomes or trends.
            It answers questions like "What is likely to happen?" and "What will happen
            next?" Techniques used in predictive analytics include machine learning
            algorithms, statistical modeling, and data mining.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnostic analysis:</strong> Diagnostic analysis is a type of
            data analysis that focuses on understanding why certain events or outcomes
            occurred by examining the underlying causes and relationships between variables.
            It goes beyond descriptive analysis to provide insights into the factors
            influencing specific outcomes.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Prescriptive Analytics</strong>: Prescriptive analytics takes
            predictive analytics a step further by not only predicting future outcomes
            but also suggesting actions that can be taken to achieve desired results.
            It answers questions like "What should we do about it?" and "What actions
            will lead to the best outcomes?" Prescriptive analytics often involves
            optimization and simulation techniques.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics involves several stages in its process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gathering and collating relevant data
            from various sources. This could include structured data (like databases)
            and unstructured data (like text documents and social media posts).</li>
          <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Preparation</strong>: This step involves refining
            and structuring the data, dealing with missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Applying various techniques to explore
            the data, identify patterns, relationships, and trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Interpretation</strong>: Drawing meaningful insights from
            the analysis results and making sense of the data.</li>
          <li><strong>Presentation and Visualization</strong>: Communicating the insights
            through visualizations, reports, dashboards, and other formats that are
            easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Making</strong>: Using the insights gained from data
            analytics to inform business decisions, strategy formulation, and problem-solving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics is widely used in various industries, including business,
          healthcare, finance, marketing, sports, and more. It can help organizations
          optimize operations, improve customer experiences, identify market opportunities,
          mitigate risks, and enhance overall performance. The advancements in technology,
          particularly in areas like machine learning and big data processing, have
          greatly expanded the capabilities and potential of data analytics.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">“<span style="color:var(--cds-color-neutral-primary);">The constant increase in data processing speeds and bandwidth, the nonstop invention of new tools for creating, sharing, and consuming data, and the steady addition of new data creators and consumers around the world, ensure that data growth continues unabated. Data begets more data in a constant virtuous cycle.</span>”
