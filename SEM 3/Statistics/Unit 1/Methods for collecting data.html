        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Involves watching and recording behaviors or events as they occur in their
            natural settings.</li>
          <li>Can be participant (researcher is part of the setting) or non-participant,
            and overt (subjects know they are being observed) or covert (subjects do
            not know).</li>
          <li>Suitable for studying behaviors in a natural context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Experiments:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Involves manipulating one or more variables to determine their effect
            on another variable.</li>
          <li>Typically conducted in controlled environments.</li>
          <li>Useful for establishing cause-and-effect relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Case Studies:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>

            group, or organization.</li>
          <li>Often incorporates multiple data collection methods (like interviews,
            observations, and document analysis).</li>
          <li>Useful for obtaining detailed and comprehensive data about the specific
            case.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Focus Groups:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>Useful for historical research and situations where primary data collection
            is not feasible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Secondary Data Analysis:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Involves analyzing data that was collected by someone else for a different
            purpose.</li>
          <li>Sources can include government statistics, previous research studies,
            and other publicly available datasets.</li>
          <li>Useful for accessing a wide range of data without the need for direct
            data collection.</li>
        </ul>
