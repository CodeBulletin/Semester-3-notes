      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Unbiased Estimation:</strong> An estimator is called unbiased if,
          on average, it produces the true value of the parameter being estimated.
          This means that if the estimation process was repeated many times, the
          average of the estimates would be equal to the true parameter value. An
          unbiased estimator does not systematically overestimate or underestimate
          the parameter.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Mathematically, an estimator&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\^θ\)</span>&nbsp;for
          a parameter&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(θ\)</span>&nbsp;is unbiased if
          the expected value of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\^θ\)</span>&nbsp;is
          equal to&nbsp;
          <br><span class="math-tex">\(E(\^\theta) = \theta\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">For example, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population
          mean. If you take many samples from a population and calculate the mean
          of each sample, the average of all these sample means will be very close
          to the population mean.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Biased Estimation:</strong> A biased estimator, on the other hand,
          does not have this property. If an estimator is biased, it means that its
          expected value is not equal to the true parameter value. In other words,
          a biased estimator systematically overestimates or underestimates the parameter.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Mathematically, an estimator&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\^θ\)</span>&nbsp;is
          biased if:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(E(\^\theta) \ne \theta\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The bias of an estimator is the difference between the estimator's expected
            value and the true value of the parameter:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\text{Bias}(\^\theta) = &nbsp;E(\^\theta) - \theta\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">For example, if you use the sample variance formula without applying Bessel's
            correction (i.e., dividing by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;instead
            of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n-1\)</span>&nbsp;for a sample size&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>), you get a biased estimator of the population variance.
              This is because it tends to underestimate the variance, especially for
              small sample sizes.</p>
