       <h1>Introduction to Statistics </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Statistics is a mathematical field focused on data collection, organization,
          analysis, interpretation, and presentation. It aims to understand raw data
          and draw conclusions, impacting areas like science, social sciences, business,
          and engineering. Key areas include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering information through surveys,
            experiments, and observations.</li>
          <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Summarizing data using averages,
            variability measures, and graphs.</li>
          <li><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Making predictions about populations
            based on sample data, using hypothesis testing and regression analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Probability:</strong> Assessing event likelihoods, essential for
            understanding randomness and uncertainty.</li>
          <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Applying methods to analyze data,
            identify trends, and make decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> Choosing subsets of large populations for study.</li>
          <li><strong>Experimental Design:</strong> Structuring experiments to control
            variables and determine causality.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Statistics is vital for evidence-based decision-making, research, prediction,
          and understanding various aspects of the world. It reduces bias and errors
          in data analysis, enhancing accuracy and reliability in numerous fields
          like public health, market research, and finance.</p>
