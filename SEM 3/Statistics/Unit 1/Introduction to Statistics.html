       <h1>Introduction to Statistics </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>Statistics is a branch of mathematics and a field of study that involves
          collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. Its
          primary purpose is to make sense of raw data and draw meaningful conclusions
          from it. Statistics plays a crucial role in various disciplines, including
          science, social sciences, business, economics, engineering, and many other
          fields.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key concepts in statistics include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Collection</strong>: This involves gathering information
            from various sources through surveys, experiments, observations, or other
            methods.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>: Descriptive statistics involves
            summarizing and describing data using measures such as averages (mean,
            median, mode), measures of variability (standard deviation, range), and
            graphical representations (histograms, bar charts, pie charts).</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Inferential Statistics</strong>: Inferential statistics aims to
            make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of
            data. It involves techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals,
            and regression analysis.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Probability</strong>: Probability is a fundamental concept in
              statistics that deals with the likelihood of events occurring. It helps
              in understanding random processes and uncertainty in data.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>: This encompasses the application
              of various statistical methods and techniques to analyze data, identify
              patterns, relationships, and trends, and make informed decisions.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Sampling</strong>: When studying large populations, it is often
              impractical to collect data from every individual. Instead, statisticians
              use sampling methods to select representative subsets of the population
              to make generalizations about the whole group.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Experimental Design</strong>: In experiments, researchers carefully
                design the data collection process to control variables and establish cause-and-effect
                relationships.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Statistics is crucial for making evidence-based decisions, conducting
          research, predicting outcomes, and understanding the world around us. It
          is widely used in fields like market research, public health, quality control,
          social sciences, finance, and sports analytics, among others. Proper application
          of statistical techniques helps reduce bias, uncertainty, and errors in
          data analysis, leading to more accurate and reliable results.</p>
