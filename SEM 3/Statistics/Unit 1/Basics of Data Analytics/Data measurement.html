        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data measurement in data analytics involves quantifying attributes to
          make data analyzable and structured for analysis, visualization, and decision-making.
          It uses different scales based on attribute nature and applicable mathematical
          operations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Nominal Scale:</strong> Categorizes data into distinct, non-ordered
            groups. Suitable for qualitative data like colors or genders, allowing
            only counting and description.</li>
          <li><strong>Ordinal Scale:</strong> Ranks data with an inherent order but without
            standardized intervals. Used for rankings and ratings, enabling order determination
            but not meaningful interval measurement.</li>
          <li><strong>Interval Scale:</strong> Features equal, meaningful intervals between
            values but no true zero point. Common in temperature measurements, suitable
            for addition and subtraction but not for multiplication or division.</li>
          <li><strong>Ratio Scale:</strong> Includes equal intervals and a meaningful
            zero point, allowing all mathematical operations. Applied to data like
            height, weight, income, and time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">These scales determine how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted,
          with each scale having unique characteristics and limitations. Measurement
          in data analytics also encompasses categorical data, requiring techniques
          that respect their inherent properties.</p>
