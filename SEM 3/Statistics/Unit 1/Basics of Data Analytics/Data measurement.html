       <h1>Data measurement</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data measurement, in the context of data analytics, refers to the process
          of quantifying and assigning values to various attributes or characteristics
          of data in order to make it meaningful and analyzable. Measurement is a
          crucial step in data analytics because it enables you to convert raw data
          into a structured format that can be used for analysis, visualization,
          and decision-making.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are different types of data measurement scales that are commonly
          used in data analytics, each with its own characteristics and purposes.
          These scales help categorize data based on the nature of the attributes
          being measured and the mathematical operations that can be applied to them.
          The most common types of data measurement scales are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Nominal Scale:</strong> This is the simplest form of measurement
            where data is categorized into distinct, non-ordered groups or categories.
            Nominal data can be qualitative in nature, such as colors, genders, or
            categories of products. Nominal data can only be counted and described,
            but mathematical operations like addition or subtraction are not meaningful
            in this scale.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Ordinal Scale:</strong> Data on an ordinal scale has an inherent
            order or ranking but the intervals between values are not standardized.
            Examples of ordinal data include rankings, ratings, and satisfaction levels.
            While you can determine the order of values, you cannot measure the differences
            between them in a meaningful way.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interval Scale:</strong> In an interval scale, the intervals between
            values are equal and meaningful, but there is no true zero point. Common
            examples include temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. While you can perform
            addition and subtraction operations on interval data, you can't perform
            multiplication or division meaningfully.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Ratio Scale:</strong> This is the most advanced measurement scale.
            Ratio scale data have equal intervals between values and a true, meaningful
            zero point. Examples include height, weight, income, and time. All mathematical
            operations can be performed on ratio scale data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">These measurement scales guide how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted.
          Depending on the type of data you're dealing with and the goals of your
          analysis, you would choose the appropriate measurement scale. It's important
          to recognize the characteristics and limitations of each scale to ensure
          that your analysis is accurate and meaningful.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Additionally, in data analytics, measurement is not limited to numerical
          values. Categorical data, such as gender or product categories, can also
          be measured using appropriate techniques that consider the inherent characteristics
          of these types of data.</p>
