       <h1>Data Collection</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data collection in analytics is the process of gathering information to
          create a dataset for analysis, with a focus on quality and relevance for
          accurate insights. Methods vary based on research goals, data nature, resources,
          and ethics. Common methods include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Surveys and Questionnaires:</strong> Structured questions through
            various mediums to gather self-reported data, opinions, and demographics.</li>
          <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Direct interactions, either structured or
            unstructured, for detailed qualitative insights.</li>
          <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Systematic recording of behaviors and events
            in real-world settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Experiments:</strong> Manipulating variables in controlled environments
            to establish cause-effect relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary Data:</strong> Using existing data from other sources
            for new analyses.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Automating data extraction from websites.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensor Data Collection:</strong> Gathering data from IoT devices
            for physical phenomena analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Media Data Collection:</strong> Analyzing trends and behaviors
            from social media platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethnographic Fieldwork:</strong> Immersing in environments to study
            behaviors and interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Diaries and Logs:</strong> Having participants record activities
            and experiences over time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Each method has advantages and challenges, and the choice depends on the
          specific research needs. A well-planned data collection strategy ensures
          the validity and reliability of data.</p>
