        <h2>Nominal Measurement</h2>
        <p>This type of measurement involves categorizing data into distinct categories
          or groups without any inherent order or ranking. Examples of nominal measurements
          include gender (male/female), color (red/blue/green), or product categories
          (electronics/clothing/books).</p>
        <h2>Ordinal Measurement</h2>
        <p>Ordinal measurement involves categorizing data into distinct categories
          or groups with an inherent order or ranking. However, the differences between
          the categories are not necessarily equal. Examples of ordinal measurements
          include rating scales (1-5 stars), educational levels (elementary/middle/high
          school/college), or customer satisfaction levels (very dissatisfied/dissatisfied/neutral/satisfied/very
          satisfied).</p>
        <h2>Interval Measurement</h2>
        <p>Interval measurement involves assigning numerical values to data where
          the differences between the values are meaningful and consistent. However,
          there is no true zero point. Examples of interval measurements include
          temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit), calendar dates, or IQ scores.</p>
        <h2>Ratio Measurement</h2>
        <p>Ratio measurement is similar to interval measurement but includes a true
          zero point, indicating the absence of the measured attribute. In ratio
          measurement, the ratios between values are meaningful and consistent. Examples
          of ratio measurements include weight, height, time, or income.</p>
