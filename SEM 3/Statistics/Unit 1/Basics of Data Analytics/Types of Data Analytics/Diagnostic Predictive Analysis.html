       <h1>Diagnostic Predictive Analysis</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Diagnostic and predictive analysis are two distinct stages in the data
          analysis process, each serving a specific purpose. Let's break down what
          each of these terms means:</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Diagnostic Analysis</strong></h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Diagnostic analysis is focused on understanding why certain events or
          outcomes occurred. It involves investigating historical data to identify
          the root causes or factors that contributed to a particular situation,
          event, or outcome. This type of analysis aims to uncover patterns, relationships,
          and trends that can provide insights into the factors that led to a specific
          result.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In diagnostic analysis, you might use techniques such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis:</strong> Identifying the underlying causes
            of a problem or outcome by analyzing the relationships between variables.</li>
          <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Examining how changes in one variable
            are associated with changes in another variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Causal Analysis:</strong> Determining whether changes in one variable
            directly cause changes in another variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example: Customer Churn Analysis for a Subscription Service</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In a streaming service scenario, diagnostic analysis is performed to understand
          customer churn using a dataset with customer behavior and subscription
          status. The dataset includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer ID</li>
          <li>Subscription Start and End Dates</li>
          <li>Number of Logins</li>
          <li>Total Watch Time</li>
          <li>Churn Status (Yes/No)</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Diagnostic Analysis Steps:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Feature Comparison:</strong> Contrast characteristics of churned
            customers with retained ones, like average logins and watch time.</li>
          <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Calculate correlations between variables
            (logins, watch time) and churn status.</li>
          <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> Test if longer watch time correlates
            with lower churn rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Group customers by usage patterns
            and analyze churn rates in each segment.</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback Analysis:</strong> If available, examine feedback from
            churned customers for common cancellation reasons.</li>
          <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Develop a model to predict churn
            using machine learning, identifying key predictive features.</li>
          <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Create visualizations, such as scatter
            plots of watch time vs. churn and box plots of login frequencies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The analysis aims to uncover factors contributing to churn, guiding strategies
          for reducing churn rates by improving content, user experience, or personalized
          engagement.</p>
