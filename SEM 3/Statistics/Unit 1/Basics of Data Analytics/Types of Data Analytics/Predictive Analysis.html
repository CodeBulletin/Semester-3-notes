        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Predictive Analysis</strong></h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Predictive analysis, on the other hand, involves using historical data
          to make predictions or forecasts about future events or outcomes. This
          type of analysis leverages patterns and relationships identified in the
          data to build models that can make predictions about what might happen
          next. Predictive analysis often uses statistical and machine learning techniques
          to create these models.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In predictive analysis, you might use techniques such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong> Modeling the relationship between
            variables to predict numerical outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Forecasting future values based
            on historical time-based data.</li>
          <li><strong>Classification Algorithms:</strong> Predicting categorical outcomes
            by classifying data into predefined classes or categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In summary, diagnostic analysis focuses on understanding past events and
          their causes, while predictive analysis aims to forecast future events
          based on historical data. Both types of analysis play crucial roles in
          data-driven decision-making and can be used together to gain a comprehensive
          understanding of a situation and make informed choices for the future.</p>

        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example: Predicting Customer Churn for a Telecom Company</strong>
          </h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">In a telecommunications company scenario, predictive analysis determines
            potential customer churn using a dataset with customer behavior and churn
            status. The dataset includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customer ID</li>
            <li>Contract Length</li>
            <li>Monthly Charges</li>
            <li>Total Charges</li>
            <li>Number of Support Calls</li>
            <li>Churn Status (Yes/No)</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Steps in Predictive Analysis:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Clean data, handle missing values,
              and encode categorical variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Choose relevant features like contract
              length, charges, and support calls.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Splitting:</strong> Divide dataset into training and testing
              sets.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Use logistic regression for churn prediction.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Train the model on historical churn data.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Assess performance using accuracy, precision,
              recall, and F1-score.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Importance:</strong> Determine which factors most influence
              predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Apply the model to new customer data to forecast
              churn likelihood.</li>
            <li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Implement strategies like offering
              incentives to high-risk customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Update and retrain the model with
              new data for accuracy.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The outcome is a model predicting churn, enabling proactive customer retention
            strategies, thereby enhancing satisfaction and reducing churn rates.</p>
