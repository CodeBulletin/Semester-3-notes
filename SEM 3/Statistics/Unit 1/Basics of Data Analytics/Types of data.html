       <h1>Types of data</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>In data analytics, there are various types of data that are commonly analyzed.
          Here are some of the main types:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Structured Data</strong>: This type of data is highly organized
            and follows a predefined format. It is typically stored in databases or
            spreadsheets and can be easily processed by machines. Examples include
            numerical data, categorical data, and time-series data.</li>
          <li><strong>Unstructured Data</strong>: Unstructured data refers to data that
            does not have a predefined format or organization. It can include text
            documents, social media posts, emails, images, videos, and audio recordings.
            Analyzing unstructured data often involves techniques like natural language
            processing (NLP) and computer vision.</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-Structured Data</strong>: Semi-structured data lies between
            structured and unstructured data. It has some organizational properties
            but does not conform to a rigid structure. Examples include XML files,
            JSON data, and log files.</li>
          <li><strong>Big Data</strong>: Big data refers to extremely large and complex
            datasets that cannot be easily managed or analyzed using traditional data
            processing techniques. It typically involves high volumes, velocity, and
            variety of data. Big data analytics often relies on distributed computing
            frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.</li>
          <li><strong>Time-Series Data</strong>: Time-series data consists of observations
            collected over time at regular intervals. It is commonly used in forecasting,
            trend analysis, and anomaly detection. Examples include stock prices, weather
            data, and sensor readings.</li>
          <li><strong>Geospatial Data</strong>: Geospatial data refers to data that
            is associated with specific geographic locations. It includes information
            like coordinates, addresses, maps, and satellite imagery. Geospatial data
            analysis is used in various fields, such as urban planning, logistics,
            and environmental monitoring.</li>
          <li><strong>Streaming Data</strong>: Streaming data refers to continuously
            generated data that is processed in real-time. It is often produced by
            sensors, IoT devices, social media feeds, and financial transactions. Streaming
            data analytics enables organizations to make immediate decisions based
            on up-to-date information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are just a few examples of the types of data commonly analyzed in
          data analytics. The choice of data type depends on the specific problem
          or question being addressed and the available data sources.</p>
