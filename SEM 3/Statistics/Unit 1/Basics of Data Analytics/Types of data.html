       <h1>Types of data</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics involves analyzing various data types, each with unique
          characteristics:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Highly organized, follows a predefined
            format, easily processed by machines. Includes numerical, categorical,
            and time-series data, commonly stored in databases or spreadsheets.</li>
          <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> Lacks a predefined format, includes
            text, social media posts, emails, images, videos, and audio. Analysis often
            requires natural language processing and computer vision.</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-Structured Data:</strong> Has some organizational properties
            but lacks a rigid structure. Examples include XML files, JSON data, and
            log files.</li>
          <li><strong>Big Data:</strong> Extremely large and complex datasets, challenging
            for traditional processing methods. Involves high volume, velocity, and
            variety, analyzed using frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.</li>
          <li><strong>Time-Series Data:</strong> Data collected over time at regular
            intervals, used for forecasting and trend analysis. Examples are stock
            prices and weather data.</li>
          <li><strong>Geospatial Data:</strong> Associated with geographic locations,
            includes coordinates, maps, and satellite imagery, used in urban planning
            and logistics.</li>
          <li><strong>Streaming Data:</strong> Continuously generated and processed in
            real-time, from sources like sensors, IoT devices, and social media.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The choice of data type depends on the specific analytical problem and
          available data sources.</p>
