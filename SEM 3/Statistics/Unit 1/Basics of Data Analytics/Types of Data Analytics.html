       <h1>Types of Data Analytics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Data analytics can be broadly categorized into four main types</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Descriptive Analytics</strong>: This type of analytics involves
            summarizing historical data to gain an understanding of what has happened
            in the past. It helps in answering questions like "What happened?" and
            "Why did it happen?" Descriptive analytics focuses on creating visualizations,
            reports, and dashboards to present data in a comprehensible format.</li>
          <li><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>: Predictive analytics involves using
            historical data to build models that can predict future outcomes or trends.
            It answers questions like "What is likely to happen?" and "What will happen
            next?" Techniques used in predictive analytics include machine learning
            algorithms, statistical modeling, and data mining.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnostic analysis:</strong> Diagnostic analysis is a type of
            data analysis that focuses on understanding why certain events or outcomes
            occurred by examining the underlying causes and relationships between variables.
            It goes beyond descriptive analysis to provide insights into the factors
            influencing specific outcomes.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Prescriptive Analytics</strong>: Prescriptive analytics takes
            predictive analytics a step further by not only predicting future outcomes
            but also suggesting actions that can be taken to achieve desired results.
            It answers questions like "What should we do about it?" and "What actions
            will lead to the best outcomes?" Prescriptive analytics often involves
            optimization and simulation techniques.</li>
