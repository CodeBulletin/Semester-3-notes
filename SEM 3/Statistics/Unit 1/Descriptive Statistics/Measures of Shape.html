       <h1>Measures of Shape</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In descriptive statistics, measures of shape provide information about
          the distribution or arrangement of data points within a dataset. These
          measures help us understand the overall pattern of the data distribution,
          including whether it is symmetrical, skewed, or has other distinctive characteristics.
          Some common measures of shape include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Skewness</strong>: Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution.
            It indicates whether the data is skewed to the left (negatively skewed),
            skewed to the right (positively skewed), or approximately symmetrical (zero
            skewness). A positive skewness indicates a longer tail on the right side
            of the distribution, while a negative skewness indicates a longer tail
            on the left side.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Kurtosis</strong>: Kurtosis measures the peakedness or flatness
            of a distribution's central peak compared to a normal distribution. It
            provides insight into whether the data has heavier or lighter tails than
            a normal distribution. High kurtosis (leptokurtic) indicates a distribution
            with heavy tails and a prominent peak, while low kurtosis (platykurtic)
            suggests lighter tails and a flatter peak.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Modality</strong>: Modality refers to the number of modes or peaks
            in a distribution. A unimodal distribution has a single peak, a bimodal
            distribution has two peaks, and a multimodal distribution has more than
            two peaks.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Outliers</strong>: While not a direct measure of shape, identifying
            outliers is important for understanding the distribution of the data. Outliers
            are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the dataset
            and can have a notable impact on the shape and interpretation of the distribution.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">These measures of shape help analysts and researchers gain a deeper understanding
          of the characteristics of the data they are working with. By examining
          skewness, kurtosis, modality, and the presence of outliers, they can make
          more informed decisions about the appropriate statistical methods to use
          and interpret the results accurately.</p>
