       <h1>Mean Deviation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Mean deviation is a measure of dispersion that quantifies the average
          distance between each data point in a dataset and the mean or median of
          that dataset. It provides information about the spread or variability of
          the data.</p>
        <h3>Mean Deviation with Mean</h3>
        <p>Mean deviation with respect to the mean is a measure of dispersion that
          quantifies the average distance between each data point in a dataset and
          the mean of that dataset. It provides information about the spread or variability
          of the data around the mean.</p>
        <p>To calculate the mean deviation with respect to the mean, you follow these
          steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the mean of the dataset.</li>
          <li>Find the absolute difference between each data point and the mean.</li>
          <li>Sum up all the absolute differences.</li>
          <li>Divide the sum by the total number of data points.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Formula:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(MD_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i|x_i-\bar{x}|}{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i}\)</span>
        </p>
        <h3>For example, let's consider the dataset: 5, 8, 10, 12, 16.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the mean: (5 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 16) / 5 = 10.2</li>
          <li>Find the absolute difference between each data point and the mean: |5
            - 10.2| = 4.8, |8 - 10.2| = 1.8, |10 - 10.2| = 0.2, |12 - 10.2| = 1.8,
            |16 - 10.2| = 5.8</li>
          <li>Sum up all the absolute differences: 4.8 + 1.8 + 0.2 + 1.8 + 5.8 = 14.4</li>
          <li>Divide the sum by the total number of data points: 14.4 / 5 = 2.88</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Therefore, the mean deviation with respect to the mean for this dataset
          is 2.88.</p>
        <h2>Mean Deviation with Median (Use this by default)</h2>
        <p>Mean deviation with respect to the median is a measure of dispersion that
          quantifies the average distance between each data point in a dataset and
          the median of that dataset. It provides information about the spread or
          variability of the data around the median</p>
        <p>To calculate the mean deviation with respect to the median, you follow
          similar steps as above, but instead of using the mean, you use the median.</p>
        <p>Formula:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(MD_{M} = \frac{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i|x_i-M|}{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i}\)</span>
        </p>
        <h3>For example, let's consider the dataset: 5, 8, 10, 12, 16.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Arrange the dataset in ascending order: 5, 8, 10, 12, 16.</li>
          <li>Find the median: The median is 10.</li>
          <li>Find the absolute difference between each data point and the median: |5
            - 10| = 5 |8 - 10| = 2 |10 - 10| = 0 |12 - 10| = 2 |16 - 10| = 6</li>
          <li>Sum up all the absolute differences: 5 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 15.</li>
          <li>Divide the sum by the total number of data points: 15 / 5 = 3.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Therefore, the mean deviation with respect to the median for this dataset
          is 3.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the mean deviation provides a measure of the average distance
          between each data point and the central tendency (mean or median) of the
          dataset. It helps to understand the dispersion or variability of the data
          points.</p>
        <h2>The coefficient of mean deviation with respect to the mean and median</h2>
        <p>The coefficient of mean deviation with respect to the mean and median
          is a measure that allows for the comparison of the mean deviations of different
          datasets, regardless of their scales or units. It provides a standardized
          measure of dispersion.</p>
        <h3>Coefficient of Mean Deviation with Mean</h3>
        <p>To calculate the coefficient of mean deviation with respect to the mean,
          you divide the mean deviation with the mean of the dataset.</p>
        <p>Coefficient of Mean Deviation with Mean = (Mean Deviation with Mean /
          Mean)</p>
        <h3>Coefficient of Mean Deviation with Median</h3>
        <p>To calculate the coefficient of mean deviation with respect to the median,
          you divide the mean deviation with the median of the dataset.</p>
        <p>Coefficient of Mean Deviation with Median = (Mean Deviation with Median
          / Median)</p>
        <p>The coefficient of mean deviation provides a relative measure of dispersion
          that allows for the comparison of datasets with different scales or units.
          A smaller coefficient indicates a lower relative dispersion, while a larger
          coefficient suggests a higher relative dispersion. It helps in comparing
          the variability of datasets and understanding the relative spread of data
          points around the mean or median.</p>
