        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Properties of Standard Deviation</h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Some of the properties of Standard Deviation are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Independent of Change of Origin: </strong>Standard Deviation is
            independent of change of origin. It means that the value of standard deviation
            remains the same if a constant is added or subtracted from all observations
            in a series.</li>
          <li><strong>Standard Deviation of the Combined Series: </strong>Just like
            the arithmetic mean, one can determine the combined standard deviation
            of two or more groups.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Never less than Mean Deviation from Mean: </strong>For a given
            set of observations, the standard deviation of the series is never less
            than its mean deviation from the mean.</li>
          <li><strong>Affected by Change of Scale: </strong>Standard Deviation is affected
            by the change of scale. It means that if a constant is multiplied or divided
            to/by all of the observations, then the standard deviation will also get
            multiplied or divided by this constant.</li>
          <li><strong>Sum of the Square of the Deviations of the items from their Arithmetic Mean is Minimum: </strong>It
            means that the sum of the squares of deviations from the mean is always
            less than the sum of squares of deviations taken from the assumed mean.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Merits of Standard Deviation</h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The merits of Standard Deviation are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Based on all Values: </strong>Every item of a series is considered
            in Standard Deviation. Therefore, a change in even one value of the series
            affects the value of standard deviation.</li>
          <li><strong>Algebraic Treatment: </strong>Further algebraic treatment is possible
            in case of standard deviation. <strong>For example, </strong>if one knows
            the standard deviation of different groups, their combined standard deviation
            can be easily determined.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Better Mathematical Process: </strong>The drawback of ignoring
            signs of deviations(as done in mean deviation) is removed in standard deviation
            through squaring of deviations.</li>
          <li><strong>Rigidly Defined: </strong>By far, standard deviation is the most
            essential and widely used measure of dispersion. It is a definite measure
            of dispersion; hence, is rigidly defined.</li>
          <li><strong>Less effect of Fluctuations in Sampling: </strong>If various independent
            samples are drawn from the same population, then we can see that the standard
            deviation of the distribution is least affected from one sample to another
            as compared to the effect caused by other measures of dispersion.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Demerits of Standard Deviation</h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The demerits of Standard Deviation are:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Difficult to Compute: </strong>As compared to other measures of
            dispersion, it is difficult to compute standard deviation.</li>
          <li><strong>Depend upon Units of Measurement: </strong>Standard Deviation
            of a series depends upon the units of measurement of the observations.
            Therefore, one cannot use standard deviation for comparing the dispersion
            of the distributions that are expressed in different units.</li>
          <li><strong>More Stress on Extreme Values: </strong>Standard Deviation gives
            more weightage to the extreme values and less weightage to the values which
            are nearer to mean.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Uses of Standard Deviation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>One can use Standard Deviation to compare the dispersions of two or more
            given distributions when the units of measurement and arithmetic means
            of the distributions are the same.</li>
          <li>Standard Deviation is also used for testing the reliability of mean. Simply
            put, the mean of a distribution which has the least standard deviation
            is considered more reliable.</li>
