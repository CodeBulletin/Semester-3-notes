       <h1>Range Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The <strong>range</strong> is a simple measure of dispersion that calculates
          the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It
          gives you an idea of how spread out the data points are from each other.
          Here's an example to illustrate the range method:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Let's say you have a dataset representing the daily temperatures (in degrees
          Celsius) in a certain city for a week:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(\{25, 31, 33, 27, 39, 34, 33\}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To find the range using the range method, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identify the maximum value</strong>: In this dataset, the maximum
            temperature is 25°C.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify the minimum value</strong>: The minimum temperature is
            18°C.</li>
          <li><strong>Calculate the range</strong>: Subtract the minimum value from
            the maximum value.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Range = Maximum&nbsp;Value − Minimum&nbsp;Value = 39 - 25 = 14</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">So, the range of the daily temperatures for the week is 14°C. This means
          that the temperatures vary by 14 degrees Celsius between the highest and
          lowest values in the dataset.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Keep in mind that the range is a very basic measure of dispersion and
          doesn't take into account the distribution of the data between the maximum
          and minimum values. It can be influenced by outliers and might not fully
          capture the overall variability of the dataset.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Coefficient of Range</h2>
        <p>The coefficient of range is a measure of dispersion used to quantify the
          spread or variability of a dataset. It is calculated by dividing the range
          (the difference between the maximum and minimum values) by the average
          or mean of the dataset, and then multiplying the result by 100 to express
          it as a percentage.</p>
        <p>Mathematically, the coefficient of range (CR) can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>CR =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{range}{max + min}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>The coefficient of range provides a relative measure of dispersion, allowing
          for comparison between datasets with different units or scales. However,
          it is less commonly used compared to other measures of dispersion, such
          as the standard deviation or variance, which provide more robust and informative
          insights into the spread of data.</p>
        <h4><strong>Significance</strong></h4>
        <p>The coefficient of range signifies the relative variability or dispersion
          of a dataset. A higher coefficient of range indicates a greater spread
          or dispersion of values within the dataset, while a lower coefficient of
          range suggests a more concentrated or less variable dataset.</p>
        <p>By expressing the range as a percentage of the mean, the coefficient of
          range allows for comparison of dispersion across datasets with different
          scales or units. It provides a simple measure of relative variability that
          can be useful in certain contexts, such as comparing the spread of data
          in different industries or regions.</p>
        <p>However, it's important to note that the coefficient of range has limitations.
          It is sensitive to outliers and can be influenced by extreme values, which
          may not accurately represent the overall variability of the dataset. Therefore,
          it is often recommended to use more robust measures of dispersion, such
          as the standard deviation or interquartile range, for a more comprehensive
          understanding of the data's spread.</p>
