       <h1>Standard Deviation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The standard deviation (Ïƒ or s) is a widely used measure of dispersion
          that calculates the average deviation of individual data points from the
          mean of the dataset. It gives us an idea of how much the data points deviate
          from the mean and how widely they are distributed. A smaller standard deviation
          indicates that the data points are generally close to the mean, while a
          larger standard deviation indicates greater variability and spread.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The formula to calculate the sample standard deviation is</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(s = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^cf_i(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{(\sum_{i=1}^cf_i) - 1}\)</span>

          <p style="margin-left:0px;">where,

            the sample standard deviation

            individual data point
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\bar{x}\)</span>&nbsp;is
            the sample mean
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is
            the size of sample</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The formula to calculate the Population standard deviation is</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(\sigma = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \mu)^2}{N} = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^Cf_i(x_i - \mu)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^Cf_i}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">where,
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\sigma\)</span>&nbsp;is
            the population standard deviation
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_i\)</span>&nbsp;is
            individual data point
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\mu\)</span>&nbsp;is
            the sample mean
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(N\)</span>&nbsp;is
            the size of population</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">It's important to note that the standard deviation is sensitive to outliers,
            meaning that if there are extreme values in the dataset, they can significantly
            impact the calculated standard deviation. This property makes the standard
            deviation a good measure of spread when dealing with symmetric and roughly
            bell-shaped distributions. However, in cases where the data distribution
            is skewed or contains outliers, other measures of dispersion like the interquartile
            range (IQR) might be more appropriate.</p>
          <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Coefficient of Standard Deviation</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">As Standard Deviation is an absolute measure of dispersion, one cannot
            use it for comparing the variability of two or more series when they are
            expressed in different units. Therefore, in order to compare the variability
            of two or more series with different units it is essential to determine
            the relative measure of Standard Deviation. Two of the relative measures
            of Standard Deviation are Coefficient of Standard Deviation and Coefficient
            of Variation.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Coefficient of Standard Deviation is a relative measure of Standard Deviation
            and is determined by dividing Standard Deviation by the Mean of the given
            data set. It is also known as the <strong>Standard Coefficient of Dispersion</strong>

          <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">What is Coefficient of Variation?</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">As Standard Deviation is an absolute measure of dispersion, one cannot
            use it for comparing the variability of two or more series when they are
            expressed in different units. Therefore, in order to compare the variability
            of two or more series with different units it is essential to determine
            the relative measure of Standard Deviation. Two of the relative measures
            of Standard Deviation are Coefficient of Standard Deviation and Coefficient
            of Variation.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Coefficient of Variation is a relative measure through which two or more
            groups of similar data are compared with respect to stability or homogeneity
            or consistency. It is the most appropriate measure and indicates the relationship
            between the standard deviation and the arithmetic mean of the given distributions/series.
            Coefficient of Variation is expressed in terms of percentage and can be
            determined using the following formula:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Coefficient of Variation CV =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((CSD * 100)\%\)</span>
