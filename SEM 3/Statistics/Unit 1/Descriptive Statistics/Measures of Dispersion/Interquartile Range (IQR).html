       <h1>Interquartile Range (IQR)</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of dispersion that is used
          to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. It is calculated as
          the difference between the upper quartile (Q3) and the lower quartile (Q1)
          of a dataset.</p>
        <p>To calculate the interquartile range, you first need to arrange the dataset
          in ascending order. Then, you find the median, which is the middle value
          of the dataset. The dataset is then split into two halves: the lower half
          and the upper half.</p>
        <p>The lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the dataset,
          and the upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the dataset.
          The interquartile range is then calculated as the difference between Q3
          and Q1.</p>
        <p>Here's an example to illustrate how to calculate the interquartile range:</p>
        <p>Consider the following dataset: 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30</p>
        <p>Arrange the dataset in ascending order: 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22,
          25, 30</p>
        <p>Calculate Q1 =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(Size \space of \space [\frac{n+1}{4}]^{th}\)</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(\frac{11}4 = 2.75 = size \space of \space [2.75] = size \space of \space
            [2] &nbsp;\space + 0.75(size \space of \space [3] - size \space of \space
            [2]) \)</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(8 + 0.75(10-8) = 8 + 1.5 = 9.5\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>Calculate Q3 =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(Size \space of \space 3[\frac{n+1}{4}]^{th}\)</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(3*\frac{11}4 = 8.25 = size \space of \space [8.25] = size \space of
            \space [8] &nbsp;\space + \frac34(size \space of \space [9] - size \space
            of \space [8])\)</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(22 + 0.25(25 - 22) = 22 + 0.75 = 22.75\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>Calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 13.25</p>
        <p>Therefore, the interquartile range for this dataset is 13.25. The IQR
          is often used as a robust measure of dispersion because it is less affected
          by extreme values or outliers in the dataset.</p>
        <h2>Quartile deviation</h2>
        <p>also known as semi-interquartile range, is a measure of dispersion that
          quantifies the spread of a dataset around the median. It is calculated
          as half of the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between
          the upper quartile (Q3) and the lower quartile (Q1) of the dataset.</p>
        <p>The formula for calculating quartile deviation is:</p>
        <p>Quartile Deviation =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{(Q3 - Q1)}2\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>Where Q3 is the upper quartile and Q1 is the lower quartile.</p>
        <p>Quartile deviation provides a measure of dispersion that is less sensitive
          to extreme values or outliers compared to other measures such as the standard
          deviation. It represents the average distance between the median and the
          quartiles, indicating the spread of the middle 50% of the data.</p>
        <p>For example, if the upper quartile (Q3) is 30 and the lower quartile (Q1)
          is 10, the quartile deviation would be:</p>
        <p>Quartile Deviation =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{(30 - 20)}2\)</span>&nbsp;=
          10</p>
        <p>This means that, on average, the data points in the middle 50% of the
          dataset deviate from the median by 10 units. Quartile deviation is often
          used in descriptive statistics to provide a robust measure of dispersion.</p>
        <h2>Coefficient of Quartile Deviation</h2>
        <p>As Quartile Deviation is an absolute measure of dispersion, one cannot
          use it for comparing the variability of two or more distributions when
          they are expressed in different units. Therefore, in order to compare the
          variability of two or more series with different units it is essential
          to determine the relative measure of Quartile Deviation, which is also
          known as the Coefficient of Quartile Deviation. It is studied to make the
          comparison between the degree of variation in different series. The formula
          for determining Coefficient of Quartile Deviation is as follows:</p>
        <p>CQD =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{Q3 - Q1}{Q3 + Q1}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>For the Above Example</p>
        <p>CQD =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{30 - 10}{30 + 10} = \frac{20}{40} = 0.5 &nbsp;\)</span>
        </p>
