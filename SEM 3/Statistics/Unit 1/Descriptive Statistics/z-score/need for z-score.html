       <h1>need for z-score</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The z-score serves several important purposes in statistics and data analysis:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Standardization of Data:</strong> Z-scores standardize data by
            transforming them into a common scale with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation
            of 1. This makes it easier to compare and analyze data points from different
            distributions that might have different scales.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparison of Data:</strong> Z-scores allow for the comparison
            of data points that come from different distributions. This is particularly
            useful when you want to understand how a specific data point compares to
            the average in its own distribution or to data points in other distributions.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Identifying Outliers:</strong> Z-scores help identify outliersâ€”data
            points that are significantly far from the mean. Outliers can be indications
            of errors, anomalies, or unusual events within the data.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Assessment of Unusualness:</strong> Z-scores can be used to determine
              how unusual or rare a data point is within its distribution. Data points
              with high absolute z-scores are more distant from the mean and are considered
              less typical or more exceptional.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> Z-scores are used in hypothesis testing
              to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a known
              population mean. By comparing the z-score to critical values, you can make
              statistical decisions about hypotheses.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Z-scores are employed in quality control
              processes to monitor and assess the consistency and reliability of products
              or processes. Deviations from expected values can trigger corrective actions.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Normalization in Machine Learning:</strong> Z-scores are used to
              normalize features in machine learning algorithms. Normalization helps
              ensure that features are on a similar scale, which can improve the performance
              of certain algorithms.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Visualizing Data:</strong> Z-scores can be used to create standardized
                plots that help visualize the distribution of data and highlight deviations
                from the mean.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Overall, z-scores provide a valuable tool for understanding the position
          and behavior of individual data points within a distribution, as well as
          for making comparisons and informed decisions in statistical analysis and
          decision-making processes.</p>
