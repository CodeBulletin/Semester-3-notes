       <h1>4. Stem And Leaf Plot</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A stem and leaf plot is a type of data visualization used to display the
          distribution of a set of numerical data. It's particularly useful for smaller
          data sets and provides insights into the frequency and distribution of
          values.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how a stem and leaf plot works:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Stem</strong>: The "stem" represents the leftmost part of the
            numbers. It typically consists of the highest place value digits shared
            by all the numbers in the data set. For example, if your data set contains
            two-digit numbers, the stem would be the tens digit.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Leaves</strong>: The "leaves" are the individual digits from the
            data values. They are placed to the right of the stem, corresponding to
            the remaining digits of each number. The leaves are arranged in ascending
            order next to their respective stems.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Organization</strong>: The stem and leaves are organized in rows.
            The same stem can have multiple leaves, indicating that those data points
            share the same stem value.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example</strong>: Let's say you have the data set [12, 18, 22,
            25, 28, 30, 36, 39]. If you use the tens digit as the stem, the stem and
            leaf plot might look like this:</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Advantages of Stem and Leaf Plots</h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Preservation</strong>: Stem and leaf plots provide a way
            to preserve the actual data values while displaying their distribution.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Small Data Sets</strong>: They are particularly useful for smaller
            data sets where other types of plots might be overly complex.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Ease of Interpretation</strong>: Stem and leaf plots are easy
              to understand and can quickly convey information about data patterns.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Visual Display</strong>: Stem and leaf plots provide a visual
              representation of the data's distribution, making it easier to identify
              key features.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Disadvantages of Stem and Leaf Plots</h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limited for Large Data Sets</strong>: Stem and leaf plots become
            unwieldy and difficult to read when dealing with larger data sets.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Less Commonly Used</strong>: While they offer simplicity and insights,
            stem and leaf plots are less commonly used compared to more standardized
            graphical representations like histograms or box plots.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Scale Sensitivity</strong>: The interpretation of stem and leaf
              plots can be sensitive to the scale chosen for the stems, which can affect
              the way patterns are perceived.</li>
