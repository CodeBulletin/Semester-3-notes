        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A grouped frequency distribution is a method of organizing and presenting
          data in a way that groups data values into intervals or "classes" and shows
          how many data points fall into each interval. It's particularly useful
          when dealing with a large range of data values, as it simplifies the representation
          and provides insights into the distribution of the data.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how a grouped frequency distribution works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Data Binning</strong>: The first step involves dividing the range
            of data values into intervals or bins. These intervals should be mutually
            exclusive (no data point should fall into more than one interval) and exhaustive
            (they should cover the entire range of data).</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency Count</strong>: For each interval, you count how many
            data points fall within that range. This count is called the frequency
            of that interval.</li>
          <li><strong>Interval Limits</strong>: Intervals are typically defined by lower
            and upper limits. The lower limit is the smallest value that belongs to
            the interval, and the upper limit is the largest value. The difference
            between the upper and lower limits is called the class width.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Advantages of Grouped Frequency Distributions:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Simplification</strong>: Grouping data into intervals makes it
            easier to manage and present large data sets.</li>
          <li><strong>Insight into Data Patterns</strong>: Grouped distributions can
            reveal patterns and trends in data, especially when the data range is extensive.</li>
          <li><strong>Ease of Interpretation</strong>: Frequency counts within intervals
            provide a clearer picture of data distribution than a long list of individual
            values.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Disadvantages of Grouped Frequency Distributions:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Loss of Detail</strong>: Grouping data results in a loss of information
            about individual values, which might be important for certain analyses.</li>
          <li><strong>Interval Choice</strong>: The choice of intervals can impact the
            way the data is perceived. Poorly chosen intervals might obscure patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Binning Bias</strong>: The way you choose intervals can influence
            the interpretation of the data, leading to potential biases.</li>
