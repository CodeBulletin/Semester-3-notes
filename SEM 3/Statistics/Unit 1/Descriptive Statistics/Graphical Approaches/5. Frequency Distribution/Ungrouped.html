       <h1>Ungrouped</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">An ungrouped frequency distribution, also known as a raw frequency distribution,
          is a simple method of organizing and displaying data by listing each individual
          data point along with its frequency (the number of times it occurs) in
          the data set. This type of distribution is commonly used when dealing with
          a relatively small data set or when the data values are distinct and not
          too numerous.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how an ungrouped frequency distribution works:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data List</strong>: Start by listing all the individual data values
            in the data set.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Count Frequency</strong>: Count the frequency of each unique data
            value, which is the number of times it appears in the data set.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Table Representation</strong>: Organize the data values in a table
            format with two columns: one for the data values and the other for their
            respective frequencies.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Advantages of Ungrouped Frequency Distributions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Ungrouped frequency distributions are straightforward
            and easy to create, making them suitable for small data sets.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Preservation of Detail</strong>: Since you list each individual
            data point, no information about the original data is lost.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Transparency</strong>: An ungrouped distribution provides complete
            transparency into how often each individual value occurs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Disadvantages of Ungrouped Frequency Distributions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limited for Large Data Sets</strong>: Handling large data sets
            with numerous unique values can make the table cumbersome and difficult
            to interpret.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Difficulty Detecting Patterns</strong>: Ungrouped distributions
            might not reveal patterns or trends as effectively as grouped distributions
            for larger ranges of data values.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Time-Consuming</strong>: Creating an ungrouped distribution for
            very large data sets can be time-consuming and repetitive.</li>
        </ol>
