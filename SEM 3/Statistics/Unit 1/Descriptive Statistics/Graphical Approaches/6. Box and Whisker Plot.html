       <h1>6. Box and Whisker Plot</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation
          of the distribution of data in a data set. It provides a visual summary
          of key statistical measures such as the median, quartiles, and potential
          outliers. Box plots are particularly useful for displaying the spread,
          central tendency, and skewness of the data.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Box Plot Give Five Number Summary of the Data</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">The Smallest Number</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">1st quartile</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">Median</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">3rd quartile</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">The Largest Number</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how a box plot works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Median Line (Box)</strong>: A box is drawn that represents the
            interquartile range (IQR) of the data. The median (middle value) of the
            data set is marked within the box.</li>
          <li><strong>Quartiles</strong>: The data set is divided into four quartiles,
            with the median representing the second quartile (Q2). The first quartile
            (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) are also shown as lines within the box.</li>
          <li><strong>Whiskers</strong>: Lines, or "whiskers," extend from the edges
            of the box to indicate the range of data within 1.5 times the IQR from
            the first and third quartiles. Data points outside this range are considered
            potential outliers and are represented individually as points beyond the
            whiskers.</li>
          <li><strong>Outliers</strong>: Individual data points that fall beyond the
            whiskers are considered potential outliers and are marked as individual
            points on the plot.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Advantages of Box Plots</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Summary of Distribution</strong>: Box plots provide a concise
            summary of the data distribution, including central tendency, spread, and
            potential outliers.</li>
          <li><strong>Outlier Detection</strong>: Outliers are clearly visible, making
            it easy to identify data points that significantly differ from the rest.</li>
          <li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Box plots allow for effective comparison
            of distributions between different data sets.</li>
          <li><strong>Visualization of Skewness</strong>: Box plots can show whether
            the data distribution is skewed and in which direction.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Disadvantages of Box Plots</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Limited Details</strong>: While box plots offer a summary of data
            distribution, they don't provide the same level of detail as histograms
            or scatter plots.</li>
          <li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Understanding the various components of a
            box plot might be less intuitive for those not familiar with statistics.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Points</strong>: The individual data points are not shown,
            which can obscure the actual values of the data set.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Symmetry</strong>: Box plots might not work well for highly
            skewed data distributions or multimodal data sets.</li>
