       <h1>3. Dot Plot</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A dot plot, also known as a dot chart or dot graph, is a simple yet effective
          type of data visualization used to display the distribution of data points
          along a single axis. Dot plots are particularly useful for visualizing
          the frequency or distribution of individual data points, especially when
          dealing with smaller data sets or when you want to emphasize each individual
          data point.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Key features of dot plots:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Single Axis</strong>: Dot plots typically use a single axis (horizontal
            or vertical) to display the data points. The position of each dot along
            the axis represents its value or category.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Dots</strong>: Each data point is represented by a single dot
            or marker placed at the appropriate position along the axis.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Overlap Handling</strong>: In case of data point overlap, dots
            can be stacked vertically or horizontally, or small adjustments can be
            made to avoid complete overlap.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Labels</strong>: Depending on the data and the scale of the plot,
            labels might be included next to the dots or along the axis to identify
            specific data points.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Use Cases</strong>: Dot plots are commonly used for illustrating
            the distribution of a small data set, highlighting individual values, and
            showcasing trends or patterns in the data.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Advantages of Dot Plots</h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Individual Data Points</strong>: Dot plots emphasize the individual
            data points, making them ideal for showcasing the exact values or data
            points themselves.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Dot plots are straightforward and easy to
            create, making them accessible even to those who are not familiar with
            complex data visualization techniques.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Distribution Insight</strong>: Dot plots offer a clear view of
            the distribution of data points, allowing viewers to easily identify gaps,
            clusters, or outliers.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparison</strong>: Dot plots can be used to compare the values
            of different data points directly, which can help in identifying differences
            or patterns.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Small Data Sets</strong>: They are particularly effective when
            dealing with small data sets where each data point holds importance.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Disadvantages of Dot Plots</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limited for Large Data Sets</strong>: Dot plots become less effective
            and more cluttered as the number of data points increases. With a large
            data set, dots can overlap, leading to difficulties in interpretation.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Scale Sensitivity</strong>: The interpretation of dot plots can
            be sensitive to the scale chosen for the axis, potentially leading to varying
            impressions of the data's distribution.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Value Labels</strong>: When there are many data points, adding
              value labels to each dot can clutter the plot and make it difficult to
              read.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Less Commonly Known</strong>: While dot plots are easy to understand,
              they might not be as widely recognized or used as other types of charts,
              which could affect their communication effectiveness.
