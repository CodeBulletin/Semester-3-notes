       <h1>7. Scatter plot</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A scatter plot, also known as a scatter diagram or scatter graph, is a
          type of data visualization that displays individual data points as dots
          on a two-dimensional coordinate system. It's particularly useful for showing
          the relationship and patterns between two variables and identifying trends,
          correlations, clusters, and outliers in the data.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how a scatter plot works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Axis Setup</strong>: The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents one
            variable, while the vertical axis (y-axis) represents the other variable.
            Each axis is labeled according to the data being plotted.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Points</strong>: Each data point in the dataset is represented
            as a dot on the scatter plot, with its position determined by the values
            of the two variables it represents.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Pattern Identification</strong>: The arrangement of dots on the
            scatter plot provides insights into the relationship between the two variables.
            Clusters, trends, patterns, and any outliers become visually apparent.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Advantages of Scatter Plots</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Pattern Identification</strong>: Scatter plots effectively show
          patterns, correlations, and trends between two variables, making them great
          for identifying relationships.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Outlier Detection</strong>: Outliers, data points that deviate
          significantly from the overall pattern, are easily spotted on a scatter
          plot.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Variable Interaction</strong>: Scatter plots can highlight how
          changes in one variable are related to changes in another variable.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparisons</strong>: Scatter plots allow you to compare data
          from different groups or data sets in a visually intuitive manner.</p>
          <h2
          style="margin-left:0px;">Disadvantages of Scatter Plots</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Overcrowding</strong>: With a large number of data points, scatter
              plots can become crowded and difficult to interpret.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Type</strong>: Scatter plots are best suited for continuous
              or numerical data, making them less appropriate for categorical data.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Complex Relationships</strong>: While scatter plots are good for
              detecting linear relationships, they might not be ideal for representing
              more complex relationships.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Missing Context</strong>: Without proper context and labels, a
                scatter plot might not effectively convey the meaning of the variables
                and their relationship.</p>
