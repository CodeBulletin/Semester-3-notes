       <h1>1. Pie Graph</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Pie graphs, also known as pie charts, are a type of data visualization
          used to represent categorical data as a circular chart. They are useful
          for illustrating the proportion or distribution of different categories
          within a whole. The entire circle represents the whole data set, and each
          "slice" of the pie represents a specific category's contribution to that
          whole. The size of each slice is proportional to the percentage of data
          it represents.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Key features of pie graphs:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Circular Representation</strong>: The pie chart is a circular
            graph, where the entire circle represents 100% of the data or the "whole."</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Slices</strong>: The circle is divided into slices or sectors,
            each representing a specific category or data point. The size of each slice
            corresponds to the proportion of that category within the whole.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Labels</strong>: Often, each slice is labeled with the category
              it represents and, optionally, its corresponding percentage or value.</li>
              <li
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Legend</strong>: If there are multiple categories in the chart,
                a legend may be included to clarify which slice corresponds to which category.</li>
                <li
                style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Angles</strong>: The angle of each slice is determined by the
                  proportion it represents in relation to the whole. The angles of all slices
                  add up to 360 degrees.</li>
                  <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Use Cases</strong>: Pie charts are typically used when you want
                    to show how a single variable is divided into various categories and how
                    those categories relate to the whole. They are particularly useful for
                    displaying relative proportions at a glance.</li>
                  <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limitations</strong>: Pie charts can become less effective when
                    there are too many categories or when the differences in proportions are
                    small. In such cases, the slices can become hard to distinguish, and other
                    types of charts might be more suitable.</li>
                  <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Representation</strong>: Pie charts are better suited for
                    displaying qualitative or categorical data. They are not as effective for
                    showing changes over time or comparing quantities between different variables.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Advantages of Pie Charts</h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Easy to Understand</strong>: Pie charts are simple and intuitive
            to understand. The visual representation of slices and the whole circle
            make it easy to grasp the proportions of different categories.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Percentage Display</strong>: Pie charts readily display the percentage
            distribution of each category, which helps viewers quickly assess the relative
            sizes of the different segments.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Effective for Few Categories</strong>: When you have a small number
              of categories and the differences in proportions are significant, a pie
              chart can be effective in showing the relative distribution of the data.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparing Parts to Whole</strong>: Pie charts are great for illustrating
              how different parts contribute to a whole. This is particularly useful
              when you want to show the composition of something, such as a budget, market
              share, or demographic distribution.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Disadvantages of Pie Charts</h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limited Categories</strong>: Pie charts become less effective
            as the number of categories increases. Too many slices can lead to visual
            clutter and confusion, making it difficult to discern the differences between
            small slices.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Difficulty Comparing Slices</strong>: Comparing the sizes of different
            slices can be challenging, especially when the differences are subtle.
            It's often easier to compare lengths in a bar chart.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Misinterpretation</strong>: People might misinterpret angles and
            areas. The human visual system isn't very accurate at judging angles and
            areas, which can lead to incorrect assessments of proportions.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cannot Show Trends</strong>: Pie charts are static and cannot
            effectively display trends over time or changes in data. If you need to
            show how data changes over a period, other chart types like line charts
            or bar charts are more suitable.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Labels</strong>: When using many categories, labeling each
              slice can clutter the chart, making it harder to read. Labels might need
              to be rotated or resized to fit, which can make the chart less user-friendly.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limited Data Details</strong>: Pie charts are best suited for
              providing a high-level overview of data distribution. They don't allow
              for the display of more detailed data such as exact values.</li>
