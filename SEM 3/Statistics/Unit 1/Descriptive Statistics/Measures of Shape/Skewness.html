       <h1>Skewness</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Skewness is a statistical measure that quantifies the asymmetry of the
          probability distribution of a dataset. In other words, it indicates whether
          the data is skewed (lopsided) to the left or right of the distribution's
          central point. Skewness is an essential concept in descriptive statistics
          because it provides insight into the shape and nature of the distribution.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">There are three main types of skewness:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Negative Skewness (Left Skewness):</strong> A distribution is negatively
              skewed when its tail extends more to the left side of the central peak.
              In other words, the majority of the data points are concentrated on the
              right side of the peak, while the left tail is longer. This results in
              a long tail on the left side of the distribution and a cluster of data
              points on the right side.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Skewness (Right Skewness):</strong> A distribution is
              positively skewed when its tail extends more to the right side of the central
              peak. This means that most of the data points are concentrated on the left
              side of the peak, while the right tail is longer. Positive skewness results
              in a long tail on the right side of the distribution and a cluster of data
              points on the left side.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero Skewness:</strong> A distribution is considered symmetric
              or approximately symmetric when its left and right sides are roughly mirror
              images of each other. In this case, the mean, median, and mode are typically
              close to each other, and the skewness value is close to zero.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The skewness of a dataset can be calculated using various statistical
            formulas, but one common method involves using the third standardized moment.
            The skewness value can help analysts understand the direction and extent
            of skew in the distribution. However, it's important to note that skewness
            is just one aspect of a distribution's shape, and it should be interpreted
            alongside other measures, such as kurtosis and visualizations of the data,
            to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data's characteristics.</p>
