       <h1>Modality</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>Modality, in the context of descriptive statistics, refers to the number
          of modes or peaks present in a frequency distribution or data set. A mode
          is a value that appears most frequently in the data, and a distribution
          can have different numbers of modes, which determine its modality.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The term "unimodal," "bimodal," and "multimodal" describe the specific
          number of modes in a distribution:</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Unimodal Distribution:</strong> A distribution is considered unimodal
              if it has one clear peak or mode. In other words, there is one value that
              appears more frequently than any other value in the data set. A bell-shaped
              normal distribution is a common example of a unimodal distribution.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bimodal Distribution:</strong> A distribution is bimodal when it
              has two distinct peaks or modes. This indicates that there are two values
              in the data set that occur most frequently, and there is a relative gap
              or trough between them. Bimodal distributions can suggest the presence
              of two distinct groups or phenomena within the data.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Multimodal Distribution:</strong> A distribution is multimodal
                if it has more than two modes, indicating that there are multiple values
                with high frequencies in the data set. Each mode may correspond to a different
                group, subpopulation, or characteristic in the data.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The concept of modality helps describe the shape and structure of a distribution,
            providing insights into the underlying patterns or clusters within the
            data. Analyzing the modality of a distribution can be useful for understanding
            complex data sets and making informed decisions about appropriate statistical
            methods or models to apply. However, it's important to use other measures
            of distribution shape, such as skewness, kurtosis, and visualizations,
            to get a comprehensive view of the data's characteristics.</p>
