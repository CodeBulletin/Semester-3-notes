       <h1>Kurtosis</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the shape of the probability
          distribution of a dataset. It specifically focuses on the tails of the
          distribution and provides information about whether the tails are heavier
          (more extreme) or lighter than those of a normal distribution.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In essence, kurtosis measures the peakedness or flatness of a distribution's
          central peak and the characteristics of its tails. A distribution with
          high kurtosis has heavier tails and a more prominent peak, while a distribution
          with low kurtosis has lighter tails and a flatter peak. The kurtosis measure
          is used to understand the tails of a distribution relative to the tails
          of a normal distribution, which has a kurtosis value of 3.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are three main types of kurtosis:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Leptokurtic (High Kurtosis):</strong> A distribution is leptokurtic
            when it has a higher kurtosis value than a normal distribution (greater
            than 3). This means that the distribution's tails are heavier than those
            of a normal distribution, and the peak is more pronounced. Leptokurtic
            distributions have more extreme values in the tails, indicating that there
            is a higher probability of observing values far from the mean.</li>
          <li><strong>Mesokurtic (Normal Kurtosis):</strong> A distribution is mesokurtic
            when its kurtosis value is close to that of a normal distribution (approximately
            3). In this case, the distribution's tails and central peak are similar
            in shape to a normal distribution. Most well-behaved datasets tend to exhibit
            mesokurtic behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Platykurtic (Low Kurtosis):</strong> A distribution is platykurtic
            when it has a lower kurtosis value than a normal distribution (less than
            3). This indicates that the distribution's tails are lighter than those
            of a normal distribution, and the peak is flatter. Platykurtic distributions
            have fewer extreme values in the tails, and the data is more concentrated
            around the mean.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Kurtosis is an important measure in descriptive statistics because it
          provides insights into the characteristics of a distribution beyond what
          measures like mean and standard deviation can reveal. However, interpreting
          kurtosis requires considering other measures of distribution shape, such
          as skewness, and visually examining the data's histogram or other graphical
          representations.</p>
