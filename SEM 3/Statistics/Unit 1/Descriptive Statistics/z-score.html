       <h1>z-score</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A z-score, also known as a standard score, is a statistical measure that
          quantifies the number of standard deviations a data point is away from
          the mean of a distribution. It is used to standardize and compare data
          points across different distributions with varying means and standard deviations.
          Z-scores allow you to understand how far a data point is from the average
          in terms of the spread of the data.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The formula to calculate the z-score for a data point x in a distribution
          with mean μ and standard deviation σ is:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(z\)</span>&nbsp;is the z-score.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;is the individual data point.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\mu\)</span>&nbsp;is the mean of the distribution.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\sigma\)</span>&nbsp;is the standard deviation
            of the distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The z-score provides important information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the z-score is positive, it indicates that the data point is above
            the mean.</li>
          <li>If the z-score is negative, it indicates that the data point is below
            the mean.</li>
          <li>The magnitude of the z-score indicates how many standard deviations the
            data point is from the mean. A larger magnitude implies a data point farther
            from the mean.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Z-scores are particularly useful in comparing data points from different
          distributions, allowing you to understand how unusual or typical a specific
          data point is within its distribution. They are also used in various statistical
          analyses, hypothesis testing, and quality control processes.</p>
