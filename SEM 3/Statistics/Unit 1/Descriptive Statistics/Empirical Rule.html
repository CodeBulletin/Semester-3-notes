       <h1>Empirical Rule</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Empirical Rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 Rule or the Three Sigma
          Rule, is a statistical guideline that describes the approximate distribution
          of data in a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve). This rule provides
          insights into how data is spread around the mean in a symmetrical and well-behaved
          manner.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">According to the Empirical Rule:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the
            mean.</li>
          <li>Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of
            the mean.</li>
          <li>Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations
            of the mean.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">This rule is particularly useful for quickly estimating the spread of
          data in a normal distribution without having to calculate exact values.
          Keep in mind that the Empirical Rule only applies to data that closely
          follows a normal distribution. In real-world scenarios, data may not always
          perfectly conform to a normal distribution, and in such cases, the rule
          might not be as accurate.</p>
