       <h1>Chebyshevâ€™s Theorem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Chebyshev's Theorem, also known as Chebyshev's Inequality, is a statistical
          theorem that provides a general and more conservative bound on the proportion
          of data points that lie within a certain number of standard deviations
          from the mean, regardless of the shape of the distribution. Unlike the
          Empirical Rule, which specifically applies to normal distributions, Chebyshev's
          Theorem is applicable to any type of distribution, whether it's symmetric,
          skewed, or irregular.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Chebyshev's Theorem states that for any data distribution (regardless
          of its shape):</p>
        <p>At least&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(1 - \frac1{k^2}\)</span>&nbsp;of
          the data lies within&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;standard
          deviations of the mean, where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;is
          any positive constant greater than 1.</p>
        <p>Mathematically this can be expressed as</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(P(|X - \mu| \le k\sigma) \ge 1 - \frac1{k^2}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(P(|X - \mu| \le k\sigma)\)</span>&nbsp;is the
            proportion of data within k standard deviations of the mean.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\mu\)</span>&nbsp;is the mean of the distribution.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\sigma\)</span>&nbsp;is the standard deviation
            of the distribution.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;is the constant that determines
            the number of standard deviations from the mean.</li>
        </ul>
