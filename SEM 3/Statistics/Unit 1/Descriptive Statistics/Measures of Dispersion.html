       <h1>Measures of Dispersion</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Measures of dispersion, also known as measures of variability or spread,
          are statistical metrics that describe the extent to which data points in
          a dataset differ from the central tendency (such as the mean, median, or
          mode). These measures provide valuable information about the spread or
          variability of data points, helping to assess the level of consistency
          or spread-out nature of the data set. In simpler terms, they give you an
          idea of how much individual data points deviate from the average or typical
          value.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Common measures of dispersion include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Range</strong>: The difference between the maximum and minimum
            values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of how far apart the
            extreme values are.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interquartile Range (IQR)</strong>: The range between the first
            quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of a dataset. It is a robust
            measure of dispersion that is less affected by outliers compared to the
            range.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Variance</strong>: The average of the squared differences between
            each data point and the mean of the dataset. Variance considers all the
            data points and provides an understanding of their collective variability.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Standard Deviation</strong>: The square root of the variance.
            It measures the average deviation of data points from the mean. It is one
            of the most widely used measures of dispersion.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)</strong>: The average of the absolute
              differences between each data point and the mean of the dataset. MAD provides
              a measure of dispersion that is less sensitive to outliers compared to
              the standard deviation.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Coefficient of Variation (CV)</strong>: The ratio of the standard
              deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage. It is used to compare
              the relative variability of different datasets with different means.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">These measures of dispersion are important because they help to assess
          the reliability of summary statistics (like the mean) and provide insights
          into the distribution of the data. In practice, the choice of a specific
          measure of dispersion depends on the characteristics of the data and the
          goals of the analysis.</p>
