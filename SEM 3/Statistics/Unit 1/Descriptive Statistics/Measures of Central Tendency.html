       <h1>Measures of Central Tendency</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that provide information
          about the center or average value of a dataset. They give us an idea of
          where the "typical" or "central" value lies within a set of data points.
          The three most common measures of central tendency are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The mean is calculated by summing up all the values
            in the dataset and then dividing by the total number of values. It is also
            referred to as the average. The mean can be affected by outliers, as it
            takes into account all values in the dataset.</li>
          <li><strong>Median:</strong> The median is the middle value in a dataset when
            the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an
            odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If there is an even
            number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The
            median is less influenced by outliers compared to the mean.</li>
          <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The mode is the value that appears most frequently
            in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal),
            or more (multimodal). Unlike the mean and median, the mode is not affected
            by outliers.</li>
          <li><strong>Percentiles</strong>: The percentiles are a statistical concept
            used to describe the relative standing of a particular value within a dataset.
            They indicate the percentage of values that are below or equal to a given
            value. In other words, a percentile gives you a way to understand how a
            specific data point compares to the rest of the dataset in terms of its
            position.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Each of these measures has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice
          of which measure to use depends on the characteristics of the data and
          the purpose of the analysis. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the data is fairly symmetric and not heavily affected by outliers,
            the mean is a good measure of central tendency.</li>
          <li>If the data is skewed or contains outliers, the median might provide a
            better representation of the central value.</li>
          <li>The mode is useful for identifying the most common value in a dataset,
            especially in categorical data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">It's important to note that these measures describe different aspects
          of central tendency and may lead to different interpretations depending
          on the context of the data. In some cases, using a combination of these
          measures can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset's
          distribution.</p>
