       <h1>Median</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In statistics, the "median" is another measure of central tendency that
          represents the middle value of a dataset when it's arranged in ascending
          or descending order. Unlike the mean, which is affected by extreme values
          (outliers), the median is resistant to outliers and gives a better sense
          of the typical value in a distribution.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To calculate the median:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Organize the Data:</strong> Arrange your data points in ascending
            or descending order.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify the Middle Value(s):</strong> If the number of data points&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is odd, the median is the middle value directly. If&nbsp;
              <span
              class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is even, the median is the average of the two middle
                values.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Let's go through an example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Suppose you have the following data set: 8, 12, 15, 19, 22</li>
          <li>Organize the data in ascending order: 8, 12, 15, 19, 22</li>
          <li>Since the total number of data points (<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>)
            is odd (5), the median is the middle value, which is the third value in
            this case: 15</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Now let's consider an example with an even number of data points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Data set: 6, 10, 14, 18, 20, 26</li>
          <li>Organize the data in ascending order: 6, 10, 14, 18, 20, 26</li>
          <li>Since the total number of data points (<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>)
            is even (6), the median is the average of the two middle values, which
            are the third and fourth values:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{14 + 18}2 = \frac{32}2 = 16\)</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In both cases, the median provides a measure of central tendency that
          is not influenced by extreme values, making it a good choice when the data
          might contain outliers.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Keep in mind that when dealing with grouped data or continuous distributions,
          the median can be calculated in a similar manner but with additional considerations.</p>
        <h2
        style="margin-left:0px;">Median of Grouped Data</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(M = l + (\frac{N}2 - cf)\frac{h}{f}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">h = interval difference</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">l = lower limit of this class</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">cf = commutative frequency of the previous class</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">f = frequency of this class</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">find N/2 then Find the class it is from using commutative frequency (value
            just above N/2)</p>
