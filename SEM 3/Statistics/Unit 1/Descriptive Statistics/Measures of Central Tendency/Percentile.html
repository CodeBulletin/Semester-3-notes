       <h1>Percentile</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A percentile is a statistical measure that indicates the relative position
          of a particular value within a dataset. It represents the value below which
          a certain percentage of the data falls. For example, the 75th percentile
          (also known as the third quartile) is the value below which 75% of the
          data lies.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To calculate a percentile, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Organize the Data:</strong> Arrange the data in ascending order.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Identify the Position:</strong> Determine the position of the desired
            percentile within the dataset. This can be done using the formula:
            <br><span class="math-tex">\(Position = \frac{P}{100} * (n + 1)\)</span>
            <br>Where:
            <ol>
              <li><span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span>&nbsp;is the desired percentile (e.g.,
                25 for the 25th percentile).</li>
              <li><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is the total number of data points.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Determine the Value:</strong> If the calculated position is a whole
              number (i.e., not a fraction), then the value at that position in the ordered
              dataset is the desired percentile. If the calculated position is a fraction,
              take the average of the values at the positions just above and just below
              the calculated position.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Suppose you have the following data set: 12, 18, 20, 24, 26, 30, 32, 35,
          40, 42</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">You want to find the 70th percentile.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Organize the data in ascending order: 12, 18, 20, 24, 26, 30, 32, 35,
          40, 42</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Calculate the position:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(Position = \frac{70}{100} * (10 + 1) = 0.7 * 11 = 7.7\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Since the calculated position (7.7) is not a whole number, take the average
          of the values at positions 7 and 8:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{32+35}2 = \frac{67}2 = 33.5\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">So, the 70th percentile of this data set is 33.5.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Percentiles are useful for understanding how individual values relate
          to the distribution of data. The median, for example, is the 50th percentile,
          and quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) are often used to divide
          data into quarters for analysis.</p>
