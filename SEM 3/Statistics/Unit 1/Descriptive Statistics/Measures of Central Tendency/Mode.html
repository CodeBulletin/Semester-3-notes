       <h1>Mode</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In statistics, the "mode" is a measure of central tendency that represents
          the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. In other words, it's
          the value that occurs with the highest frequency.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To calculate the mode:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identify Frequencies:</strong> Count how many times each unique
            value appears in the dataset.</li>
          <li><strong>Find the Value with the Highest Frequency:</strong> The mode is
            the value that has the highest frequency.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's an example to illustrate the process:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Suppose you have the following data set: 5, 7, 8, 9, 7, 6, 5, 9, 7</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Count the frequencies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>5 appears 2 times</li>
            <li>6 appears 1 time</li>
            <li>7 appears 3 times</li>
            <li>8 appears 1 time</li>
            <li>9 appears 2 times</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The value 7 has the highest frequency (3 times), so the mode of this data
            set is 7.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">It's important to note that a dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two
            modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal) if multiple values
            have the same highest frequency.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Unlike the mean and median, the mode doesn't require any calculations
            involving arithmetic operations. It's simply the value with the highest
            frequency in the dataset. The mode can be particularly useful when dealing
            with categorical data or discrete data that exhibit clear peaks in frequency
            distribution.</p>
