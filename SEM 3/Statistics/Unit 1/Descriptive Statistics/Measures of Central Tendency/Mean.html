       <h1>Mean</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In statistics, the "mean" is a measure of central tendency that represents
          the average value of a set of data points. It's calculated by summing up
          all the values in the data set and then dividing by the number of data
          points.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The formula for calculating the mean (also known as the arithmetic mean)
          of a set of data points&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_{n-2}, x_{n-1}, x_n\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(Mean (\bar{x}|\mu) = \frac{x_1+ x_2+ x_3+ ...+x_{n-2}+ x_{n-1}+ x_n}{n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{n}\)</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{p}f_i*x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{p}f_i}\)</span>​</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_{n-2}, x_{n-1}, x_n\)</span>​
            are the individual data points.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is the total number of data points.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a step-by-step example of how to calculate the mean:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Let's say you have the following data set: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Add up all the values:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 100\)</span>
          </li>
          <li>Count the number of data points:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n = 5\)</span>
          </li>
          <li>Divide the sum by the number of data points:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(Mean(\bar{x}|\mu) = \frac{10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30}{5} = \frac{100}{5} = 20\)</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">So, the mean of this data set is 20.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Keep in mind that the mean can be sensitive to outliers, which are extreme
          values that can distort the average. In some cases, other measures of central
          tendency like the median (middle value when data is ordered) or mode (most
          frequently occurring value) might be more appropriate, depending on the
          characteristics of your data and your specific analysis goals.</p>
