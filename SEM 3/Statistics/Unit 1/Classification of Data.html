       <h1>Classification of Data</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>Data can be classified in various ways depending on its nature, the level
          of measurement, and the purpose of its use. Here are some common classifications
          of data:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Qualitative vs Quantitative Data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Qualitative Data:</strong> Non-numerical data that represents attributes,
            properties, or characteristics. It can be observed but not measured. Examples
            include colors, textures, opinions, and sentiments.</li>
          <li><strong>Quantitative Data:</strong> Numerical data that can be measured
            and quantified. Examples include height, weight, temperature, and scores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Discrete vs Continuous Data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discrete Data:</strong> Data that can only take certain values
            and cannot be made more precise. Examples include the number of students
            in a class, the number of cars in a parking lot.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous Data:</strong> Data that can take any value within a
            range. It can be measured and divided into smaller parts. Examples include
            height, weight, and time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Primary vs Secondary Data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Primary Data:</strong> Data collected firsthand for a specific
            research purpose. Examples include survey responses, experimental data,
            and observations.</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary Data:</strong> Data collected by someone else for a different
            purpose, but used for a new research. Examples include census data, data
            from books or articles, and information from databases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Nominal vs Ordinal vs Interval vs Ratio (Levels of Measurement):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nominal Data:</strong> Data used for labeling or naming categories
            without a specific order. Examples include gender, nationality, or hair
            color.</li>
          <li><strong>Ordinal Data:</strong> Data that involves order or ranking but
            without a fixed interval between categories. Examples include class grades
            (A, B, C, D, F), satisfaction ratings (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied).</li>
          <li><strong>Interval Data:</strong> Numeric data where the intervals between
            values are meaningful, but there is no true zero point. Examples include
            temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, calendar years.</li>
          <li><strong>Ratio Data:</strong> Numeric data with a true zero point. Differences
            and ratios are meaningful. Examples include height, weight, time, and age.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cross-sectional vs Longitudinal Data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cross-sectional Data:</strong> Data collected at one specific point
            in time, providing a snapshot view. Examples include a survey conducted
            among students in a year.</li>
          <li><strong>Longitudinal Data:</strong> Data collected over an extended period,
            allowing for the study of change and development. Examples include data
            collected in a longitudinal study of a population over decades.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Structured vs Unstructured Data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Highly organized and easily searchable
            data, usually in rows and columns (like databases and spreadsheets).</li>
          <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> Data with no predefined format, harder
            to process and analyze. Examples include text files, videos, and social
            media posts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Time Series vs Panel Data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time Series Data:</strong> Data points collected or observed at
            successive time intervals. Examples include daily stock market prices,
            monthly rainfall data.</li>
          <li><strong>Panel Data:</strong> A combination of cross-sectional and time-series
            data where observations of multiple subjects are made over time. Examples
            include data on income levels of various families observed over several
            years.</li>
        </ul>
