       <h1>Terminologies </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Population</strong>: The entire group or set of individuals, objects,
          or events that a researcher wants to study or draw conclusions about.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Sample</strong>: A subset of the population that is selected for
          data collection and analysis. The characteristics of the sample are used
          to make inferences about the population.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Variable</strong>: A characteristic or attribute that can take
            different values. Variables can be classified as independent (predictor)
            or dependent (response) variables.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data</strong>: The values or observations collected for one or
            more variables. Data can be numerical (quantitative) or categorical (qualitative).</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>: Techniques used to summarize
            and describe the main features of a dataset. Examples include measures
            of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (range,
            standard deviation).</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Inferential Statistics</strong>: Methods used to make inferences
              and predictions about a population based on sample data. Examples include
              hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: A testable statement or claim about a population
              parameter that researchers aim to support or reject through data analysis.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Hypothesis Testing</strong>: A statistical procedure used to determine
              whether there is enough evidence to support or reject a hypothesis based
              on sample data.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Confidence Interval</strong>: A range of values constructed around
                a sample statistic, such as a mean or proportion, which is likely to contain
                the population parameter with a certain level of confidence.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Sampling</strong>: The process of selecting a subset (sample)
                from the larger group (population) for data collection and analysis.</p>
              <p
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Probability</strong>: The likelihood of an event or outcome occurring.
                It is used to study random processes and uncertainty.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Correlation</strong>: A statistical measure that indicates the
                  degree of association between two variables. It can be positive, negative,
                  or zero.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Regression</strong>: A statistical method used to model the relationship
                  between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.</p>
                <p
                style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Outlier</strong>: An extreme value that significantly differs
                  from other values in a dataset and may distort the overall analysis.</p>
                  <p
                  style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Distribution</strong>: The pattern of how data values are
                    spread across a range of possible values. Common distributions include
                    normal, uniform, and exponential distributions.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>P-value</strong>: The probability of obtaining results as extreme
                      or more extreme than those observed if the null hypothesis is true. It
                      is used in hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance.</p>
