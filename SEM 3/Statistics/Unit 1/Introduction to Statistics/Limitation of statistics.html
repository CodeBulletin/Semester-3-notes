       <h1>Limitation of statistics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">While statistics is a powerful tool for data analysis and inference, it
          also has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting results
          and drawing conclusions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Sample Bias</strong>: The accuracy of statistical conclusions
            heavily depends on the quality and representativeness of the data sample.
            If the sample is not truly representative of the population of interest,
            the results may not be generalizable.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Quality</strong>: The accuracy of statistical analyses relies
            on the quality of the data used. Errors, missing values, or outliers in
            the data can lead to biased or misleading results.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Causation vs. Correlation</strong>: Statistics can establish correlations
            between variables, but it does not necessarily prove causation. Just because
            two variables are related does not mean that one causes the other.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Simplification</strong>: Statistical analyses often involve simplifying
            complex real-world phenomena to numerical measures, leading to some loss
            of information and nuances.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Assumptions</strong>: Many statistical methods assume certain
              conditions to be met for their validity. Violating these assumptions can
              lead to incorrect results.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Variability</strong>: Data variability is common, especially in
              natural and social sciences. Statistical analyses may not account for all
              sources of variability, leading to uncertainty in conclusions.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Misinterpretation</strong>: Misinterpretation of statistical results
              is a common issue, leading to incorrect conclusions and decisions.</li>
              <li
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Ethical Issues</strong>: The use of statistics in certain contexts,
                such as social research, may raise ethical concerns, especially regarding
                privacy and data protection.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Sensitivity to Outliers</strong>: Outliers (extreme values) in
                  data can significantly impact statistical measures like the mean and standard
                  deviation, potentially leading to misleading conclusions.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Overfitting</strong>: In machine learning and predictive modeling,
                  overly complex models can fit noise in the data rather than the underlying
                  patterns, leading to poor generalization to new data.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Scope of Inference</strong>: Statistical results are often limited
                  to the specific context of the data and cannot always be extended to broader
                  scenarios.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To overcome some of these limitations, it is essential to use appropriate
          statistical methods, validate assumptions, carefully interpret results,
          and consider the context in which the statistics are being applied. Using
          statistics in conjunction with domain knowledge and critical thinking can
          lead to more reliable and meaningful conclusions.</p>
