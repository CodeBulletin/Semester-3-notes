       <h1>Limitation of statistics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Statistics, while powerful for data analysis, has limitations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Sample Bias:</strong> Results depend on sample representativeness;
            non-representative samples lead to non-generalizable conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Quality:</strong> Analysis accuracy relies on data quality.
            Errors, missing values, or outliers can skew results.</li>
          <li><strong>Causation vs. Correlation:</strong> Statistics show correlations,
            not causation. Related variables don't imply one causes the other.</li>
          <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> Reducing complex phenomena to numbers
            can lose information and nuances.</li>
          <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Statistical methods assume certain conditions;
            violating these leads to incorrect results.</li>
          <li><strong>Variability:</strong> Natural and social sciences data variability
            can lead to uncertain conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Misinterpretation:</strong> Common misinterpretations of results
            can lead to incorrect conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethical Issues:</strong> Concerns in contexts like social research,
            especially around privacy and data protection.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensitivity to Outliers:</strong> Extreme values can significantly
            influence measures like mean and standard deviation, potentially misleading
            conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> In machine learning, complex models fitting
            data noise rather than patterns lead to poor generalization.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope of Inference:</strong> Results are context-specific and may
            not extend to broader scenarios.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Overcoming these limitations involves using appropriate methods, validating
          assumptions, careful interpretation, and combining statistics with domain
          knowledge and critical thinking for reliable conclusions.</p>
