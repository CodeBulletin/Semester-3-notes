       <h1>Types of Variables</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Categorical Variables</strong></h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Categorical variables are variables that represent distinct categories
          or groups and can take on a limited, fixed number of values. These values
          don't have any inherent numerical meaning. There are two main types of
          categorical variables:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Nominal Variable</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Nominal
          variables are categorical variables that represent different categories
          without any inherent order or ranking among them. Examples of nominal variables
          include colors, gender (male, female, non-binary), and types of animals
          (dog, cat, bird).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Ordinal Variable</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Ordinal
          variables are categorical variables that have a clear order or ranking
          among the categories, but the differences between the categories are not
          necessarily uniform or measurable. Examples of ordinal variables include
          education levels (high school, college, graduate school), customer satisfaction
          ratings (e.g., very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very
          satisfied), and socioeconomic classes (low, middle, high).</p>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Quantitative Variables</strong></h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Quantitative variables, also known as numerical variables or continuous
          variables, represent measurements or quantities that can be expressed as
          numerical values. These variables can be subjected to mathematical operations
          and have meaningful numerical interpretations. There are two main types
          of quantitative variables:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Discrete Variables</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Discrete
          variables are quantitative variables that take on distinct, separate values
          with gaps between them. These values are typically whole numbers. Examples
          of discrete variables include the number of cars in a parking lot, the
          count of students in a classroom, and the number of customer complaints
          in a week.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Continuous Variables</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Continuous
          variables are quantitative variables that can take on an infinite number
          of values within a certain range. These values are typically measured using
          real numbers and can include decimal points. Examples of continuous variables
          include height, weight, temperature, and time.</p>
