        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Descriptive Statistics</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> is a branch of statistics that
          involves the summary and presentation of data in a meaningful and informative
          way. Its primary purpose is to describe and summarize the main features
          of a dataset, providing a clear and concise overview of the data without
          making any inferences or drawing conclusions beyond the dataset itself.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The main techniques used in descriptive statistics include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Measures of Central Tendency</strong>: These are statistics that
              represent the center or typical value of a dataset. The three most common
              measures of central tendency are:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean</strong>: The arithmetic average of all the data points.</li>
                <li><strong>Median</strong>: The middle value of the data when arranged in
                  ascending or descending order.</li>
                <li><strong>Mode</strong>: The value that appears most frequently in the dataset.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Measures of Variability</strong>: These statistics provide information
              about the spread or dispersion of data points. Some common measures of
              variability are:
              <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li><strong>Range</strong>: The difference between the maximum and minimum
                  values in the dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard</strong>  <strong>Deviation</strong>: A measure of how
                  much the data points deviate from the mean. It quantifies the spread of
                  data.</li>
                <li><strong>Variance</strong>: The square of the standard deviation, also
                  used to measure data spread.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Frequency Distributions</strong>: A frequency distribution is
              a table or graph that shows the number of times each value or range of
              values occurs in a dataset.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Graphical Representations</strong>: Various graphs and charts
              are used to visually summarize data, such as:
              <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li>Histograms: Used to display the frequency distribution of continuous data.</li>
                <li>Bar Charts: Used for categorical data, where each category is represented
                  by a bar.</li>
                <li>Pie Charts: Used to display proportions or percentages of different categories
                  in a dataset.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Descriptive statistics provides valuable insights into the overall characteristics
            of the data, helping researchers and analysts to understand its shape,
            distribution, central values, and variability. It is often the first step
            in data analysis and serves as a foundation for more advanced statistical
            techniques like inferential statistics, which involves making inferences
            and predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Inferential Statistics</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that involves making
              inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data.
              It allows researchers and analysts to draw conclusions beyond the specific
              data they have collected and make generalizations to larger populations.
              The ultimate goal of inferential statistics is to gain insights and make
              informed decisions about the broader context from which the data was collected.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;">The process of inferential statistics typically involves the following
              steps:</p>
              <ol>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Formulating Hypotheses</strong>: Researchers start by formulating
                  hypotheses about the population based on the research question or problem
                  at hand. A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested and potentially
                  proven or disproven through data analysis.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Selecting a Sample</strong>: Instead of collecting data from the
                  entire population, a representative sample is selected. The sample should
                  be chosen using appropriate sampling techniques to ensure it is unbiased
                  and representative of the population.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Collecting Data</strong>: Data is collected from the selected
                  sample using various methods, such as surveys, experiments, or observational
                  studies.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Analyzing Data</strong>: Statistical techniques are applied to
                  the sample data to estimate population parameters and draw conclusions
                  about the population. Common inferential statistical methods include hypothesis
                  testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Drawing Conclusions</strong>: Based on the analysis of the sample
                  data, conclusions are drawn about the population. This may involve accepting
                  or rejecting the hypotheses formulated at the beginning of the process.</li>
                <li
                style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Generalizing to the Population</strong>: The findings from the
                  sample are used to make inferences about the entire population from which
                  the sample was drawn. This is done with the understanding that there is
                  always some level of uncertainty associated with the generalization.</li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Inferential statistics is widely used in various fields, such as scientific
                research, social sciences, business, medicine, and more. It allows researchers
                to make data-driven decisions, test hypotheses, and gain insights into
                larger populations without having to collect data from every individual
                in that population. However, it's crucial to interpret inferential results
                carefully, taking into account factors like sampling error and the assumptions
                made during the analysis process to ensure the validity and reliability
                of the conclusions.</p>
