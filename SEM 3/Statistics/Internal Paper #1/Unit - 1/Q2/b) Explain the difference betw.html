        <h2>Mean deviation</h2>
        <p>Mean deviation is a measure of dispersion that quantifies the average
          distance between each data point in a dataset and the mean or median of
          that dataset. It provides information about the spread or variability of
          the data.</p>
        <h3>Mean Deviation with Mean</h3>
        <p>Mean deviation with respect to the mean is a measure of dispersion that
          quantifies the average distance between each data point in a dataset and
          the mean of that dataset. It provides information about the spread or variability
          of the data around the mean.</p>
        <p>Formula:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(MD_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i|x_i-\bar{x}|}{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i}\)</span>
        </p>
        <h3>For example, let's consider the dataset: 5, 8, 10, 12, 16.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the mean: (5 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 16) / 5 = 10.2</li>
          <li>Find the absolute difference between each data point and the mean: |5
            - 10.2| = 4.8, |8 - 10.2| = 1.8, |10 - 10.2| = 0.2, |12 - 10.2| = 1.8,
            |16 - 10.2| = 5.8</li>
          <li>Sum up all the absolute differences: 4.8 + 1.8 + 0.2 + 1.8 + 5.8 = 14.4</li>
          <li>Divide the sum by the total number of data points: 14.4 / 5 = 2.88</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Mean Deviation with Median (Use this by default)</h2>
        <p>Mean deviation with respect to the median is a measure of dispersion that
          quantifies the average distance between each data point in a dataset and
          the median of that dataset. It provides information about the spread or
          variability of the data around the median</p>
        <p>To calculate the mean deviation with respect to the median, you follow
          similar steps as above, but instead of using the mean, you use the median.</p>
        <p>Formula:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(MD_{M} = \frac{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i|x_i-M|}{\sum^C_{i=1}f_i}\)</span>
        </p>
        <h3>For example, let's consider the dataset: 5, 8, 10, 12, 16.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Arrange the dataset in ascending order: 5, 8, 10, 12, 16.</li>
          <li>Find the median: The median is 10.</li>
          <li>Find the absolute difference between each data point and the median: |5
            - 10| = 5 |8 - 10| = 2 |10 - 10| = 0 |12 - 10| = 2 |16 - 10| = 6</li>
          <li>Sum up all the absolute differences: 5 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 15.</li>
          <li>Divide the sum by the total number of data points: 15 / 5 = 3.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">The standard deviation</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The standard deviation (Ïƒ or s) is a widely used measure of dispersion
          that calculates the average deviation of individual data points from the
          mean of the dataset. It gives us an idea of how much the data points deviate
          from the mean and how widely they are distributed. A smaller standard deviation
          indicates that the data points are generally close to the mean, while a
          larger standard deviation indicates greater variability and spread.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The formula to calculate the sample standard deviation is</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(s = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^cf_i(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{(\sum_{i=1}^cf_i) - 1}\)</span>
