        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(a)</strong></span> The Hawaii Visitors
          Bureau collects data on visitors to Hawaii. The following questions were
          among 16 asked in a questionnaire handed out to passengers during incoming
          airline flights.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This trip to Hawaii is my: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.</li>
          <li>The primary reason for this trip is: (10 categories, including vacation,
            convention, honeymoon).&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Where I plan to stay: (11 categories, including hotel, apartment, relatives,
            camping).</li>
          <li>Total days in Hawaii.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman;">
          <li>What is the population being studied?</li>
          <li>Is the use of a questionnaire a good way to reach the population of passengers
            on incoming airline flights?</li>
          <li>Comment on each of the four questions in terms of whether it will provide
            categorical or quantitative data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(I)</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>The population being studied in this case is the <strong>group of passengers on incoming airline flights to Hawaii</strong>.
          This group includes tourists, business travelers, and any other individuals
          arriving in Hawaii via airline flights.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(II)</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p>Using a questionnaire handed out during incoming airline flights is a
          generally effective method for reaching this specific population. Since
          all passengers on these flights are part of the target population, distributing
          questionnaires during flights ensures direct access to a relevant and captive
          audience. Additionally, the context of being on a flight to Hawaii might
          make respondents more inclined to provide accurate and thoughtful answers
          related to their trip.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(III)</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>This trip to Hawaii is my: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This question provides <strong>quantitative data</strong>. It asks for
            a numeric value indicating the number of times the respondent has visited
            Hawaii.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The primary reason for this trip is: (10 categories, including vacation, convention, honeymoon).</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This question yields <strong>categorical data</strong>. It asks the respondent
            to select their primary reason for visiting from a set list of categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Where I plan to stay: (11 categories, including hotel, apartment, relatives, camping).</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This question also provides <strong>categorical data</strong>. It requires
            respondents to choose their accommodation type from predefined categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Total days in Hawaii.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This question produces <strong>quantitative data</strong> as it asks for
            a specific number, representing the total days the respondent plans to
            spend in Hawaii.</li>
