        <p>A seven-year medical research study reported that women whose mothers
          took the drug DES during pregnancy were twice as likely to develop tissue
          abnormalities that might lead to cancer as were women whose mothers did
          not take the drug.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(I)</strong></span> This study compared
          two populations. What were the populations?</p>
        <p>The study compared two distinct populations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Women whose mothers took the drug DES during pregnancy.</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Women whose mothers did not take the drug DES during pregnancy.</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(ii)</strong></span> Do you suppose the
          data were obtained in a survey or an experiment?</p>
        <p>Given the context, it's more likely that the data were obtained through
          a <strong>survey or observational study</strong> rather than an experiment.
          This is because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It involves historical data (drug intake during pregnancy of participants'
            mothers).</li>
          <li>An experiment would require controlled administration of the drug, which
            is not ethical or feasible in this scenario.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(iii)</strong></span> For the population
          of women whose mothers took the drug DES during pregnancy, a sample of
          3980 women showed that 63 developed tissue abnormalities that might lead
          to cancer. Provide a descriptive statistic that could be used to estimate
          the number of women out of 1000 in this population who have tissue abnormalities.</p>
        <p>For the population of women whose mothers took DES, a sample of 3980 women
          showed that 63 developed tissue abnormalities. To estimate the number per
          1000:
          <br><span class="math-tex">\(Estimated \space number \space per \space 1000=\frac{63}{3980}*1000 = 15.83\)</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(iv)</strong></span> For the population
          of women whose mothers did not take the drug DES during pregnancy, what
          is the estimate of the number of women out of 1000 who would be expected
          to have tissue
          <br>abnormalities?</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(Estimated \space number \space per \space NONDES \space group=\frac{15.83}{2} = 7.91\)</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>(v)</strong></span> Medical studies often
          use a relatively large sample (in this case, 3980). Why?</p>
        <p>Large sample sizes, like 3980 in this case, are used in medical studies
          for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Increase Statistical Power</strong>: Larger samples reduce the
            margin of error and increase the confidence in the results.</li>
          <li><strong>Generalizability</strong>: A larger sample size is more likely
            to be representative of the population, making the findings more generalizable.</li>
          <li><strong>Detect Small Effect Sizes</strong>: Larger samples can detect
            smaller differences or effects that might be missed in smaller samples.</li>
          <li><strong>Account for Variability</strong>: They help account for individual
            differences and variability in responses to treatments or exposures.</li>
        </ul>
