        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Standard &amp; Poor's
          500 Index (S&amp;P 500) are both used to measure the performance of the
          stock market. The DJIA is based on the price of stocks for 30 large companies;
          the S&amp;P 500 is based on the price of stocks for 500 companies. If both
          the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 measure the performance of the stock market, how
          are they correlated? The following data show the daily percent increase
          or daily percent decrease in the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 for a sample of nine
          days over a three-month period.</p>

        <p>The strong positive correlation (approximately 0.747) between the DJIA
          (Dow Jones Industrial Average) and the S&amp;P 500 (Standard &amp; Poor's
          500 Index) indicates a significant association in their daily performance.
          This correlation suggests that movements in one index are often mirrored
          by similar movements in the other.</p>
        <p>In short, no, you do not necessarily need to check both the DJIA and the
          S&amp;P 500 to get a general idea about the daily stock market performance,
          as there is a strong positive correlation between them. However, for a
          more comprehensive understanding, considering both can provide a fuller
          picture due to their differences in composition and coverage.</p>
