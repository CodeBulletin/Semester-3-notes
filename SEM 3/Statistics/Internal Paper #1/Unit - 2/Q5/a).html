        <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that during November, 83.4%
          of Southwest 5 Airlines' flights, 75.1% of US Airways' flights, and 70.1%
          of JetBlue's flights arrived on time (USA Today, January 4, 2007). Assume
          that this on-time performance is applicable for flights arriving at concourse
          A of the Rochester International Airport, and that 40% of the arrivals
          at concourse A are Southwest Airlines flights, 35% are US Airways flights,
          and 25% are JetBlue flights.</p>

        <p><strong>(ii) An announcement has just been made that Flight 1424 will be arriving at gate 20 in concourse A. What is the most likely airline for this arrival?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>you can expect that Flight 1424 is most likely to be operated by the airline
          with the highest percentage, which is Southwest Airlines with 40%. Therefore,
          the most likely airline for the arrival of Flight 1424 at gate 20 in concourse
          A is Southwest Airlines.</p>
        <p>(iii) What is the probability that Flight 1424 will arrive on time?</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(p(flight \space 1424 \space is \space on \space time) = 0.3336 + 0.26285 + 0.1402 = 0.73665\)</span>
