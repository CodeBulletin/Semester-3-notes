       <h1>Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to compare means
          and assess whether there are statistically significant differences among
          the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. It is a parametric
          statistical technique that extends the t-test beyond two groups. The fundamental
          idea behind ANOVA is to partition the total variability observed in a set
          of data into different components, including the variability between groups
          and the variability within groups.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The basic principles of ANOVA include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong> The null hypothesis typically assumes
            that there is no significant difference among the group means. It states
            that the population means are equal.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):</strong> The alternative hypothesis
            contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests that at least one group mean
            is different from the others.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Test Statistic (F-ratio):</strong> The ANOVA test generates an
            F-ratio, which is the ratio of the variance between groups to the variance
            within groups. If the between-group variance is significantly larger than
            the within-group variance, the F-ratio will be large, and this suggests
            that there are differences among the group means.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Degrees of Freedom:</strong> ANOVA involves two degrees of freedom:
            one for the between-group variance and one for the within-group variance.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Decision Rule:</strong> The decision to reject the null hypothesis
            is based on comparing the calculated F-ratio with a critical value from
            the F-distribution table, considering a chosen significance level (commonly
            0.05).</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">ANOVA is widely used in various fields such as experimental psychology,
          biology, economics, and many others, where researchers want to compare
          the means of more than two groups. There are different types of ANOVA depending
          on the experimental design:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>One-Way ANOVA:</strong> Compares means across three or more groups
            with one independent variable.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Two-Way ANOVA:</strong> Involves two independent variables, allowing
            for the assessment of their individual effects and any interaction between
            them.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Repeated Measures ANOVA:</strong> Deals with repeated measurements
            on the same subjects over time or under different conditions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">ANOVA is a powerful tool but has assumptions, including the assumption
          of normality and homogeneity of variances. Violations of these assumptions
          might affect the validity of the results. Post-hoc tests, such as Tukey's
          test or Bonferroni correction, are often employed after ANOVA to identify
          which specific groups differ from each other when a significant difference
          is found.</p>
