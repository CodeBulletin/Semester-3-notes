       <h1>Curve Fitting</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Curve fitting, also known as regression analysis, is a statistical technique
          used in mathematics and data analysis to model the relationship between
          variables. The goal of curve fitting is to find the best-fit curve or mathematical
          function that describes the data points in a given dataset.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In curve fitting, a mathematical model or equation is chosen to represent
          the general form of the relationship between the variables. This model
          typically has parameters that need to be adjusted to minimize the difference
          between the predicted values from the model and the actual observed values
          in the dataset.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The process of curve fitting involves finding the optimal values for the
          parameters of the chosen model. This is often done using optimization techniques
          that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted
          and observed values, known as the "least squares" method. The resulting
          curve or function is considered the best fit for the data in terms of the
          chosen mathematical model.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Curve fitting can be applied in various fields, including physics, engineering,
          economics, biology, and many others. It is commonly used in data analysis
          to understand the underlying patterns or trends in a dataset, make predictions,
          and interpolate or extrapolate values beyond the observed data points.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">There are different types of curve fitting, ranging from linear regression
          (fitting a straight line) to more complex models involving polynomials,
          exponentials, logarithmic functions, and other mathematical forms. The
          choice of the appropriate model depends on the nature of the data and the
          underlying relationships between the variables.</p>
