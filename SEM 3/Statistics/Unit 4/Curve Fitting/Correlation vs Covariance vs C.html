       <h1>Correlation vs Covariance vs Causation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Correlation:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Correlation measures the statistical association
            between two variables. It indicates whether and how much two variables
            change together. It does not imply causation.</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> The correlation coefficient is a measure
            of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
            The most common measure is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which ranges
            from -1 to 1. A positive value indicates a positive correlation, a negative
            value indicates a negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Covariance:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Covariance is a measure of how much two variables
            change together. It is similar to correlation but without the normalization.
            Like correlation, covariance does not imply causation.</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> The covariance between two variables is calculated
            by taking the average of the product of the differences between each variable
            and its mean.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Causation:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Causation implies a cause-and-effect relationship
            between two variables. It means that a change in one variable directly
            causes a change in another. Establishing causation is more complex than
            establishing correlation or covariance and often requires controlled experiments.</li>
          <li><strong>Cautions:</strong> Just because two variables are correlated does
            not mean one causes the other. There could be other factors at play, and
            correlation does not imply causation. Establishing causation typically
            requires more rigorous study designs, such as randomized controlled trials.</li>
