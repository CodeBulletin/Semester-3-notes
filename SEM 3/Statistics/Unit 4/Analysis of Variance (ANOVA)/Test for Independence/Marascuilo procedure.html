       <h1>Marascuilo procedure</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Marascuilo procedure is a statistical method used for making pairwise
          comparisons of proportions when dealing with more than two groups. It is
          particularly useful when you have conducted a Chi-Square Test of Homogeneity
          and found significant differences, but you need to know exactly which pairs
          of proportions are significantly different. This procedure allows you to
          simultaneously compare multiple pairs of proportions to identify where
          the significant differences lie.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Elements of the Marascuilo Procedure:</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To identify which specific pairs of proportions
          are significantly different after a Chi-Square Test of Homogeneity indicates
          that there are differences among three or more groups.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct a Chi-Square Test of Homogeneity and determine if there are significant
            differences among the proportions.</li>
          <li>If the test is significant, calculate the critical values for each pairwise
            comparison using the Marascuilo formula.</li>
          <li>Compare the absolute difference between each pair of sample proportions
            to the corresponding critical value. If the difference is greater than
            the critical value, the difference between those two proportions is significant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interpretation</strong>: This procedure identifies specific pairs
          of proportions that are significantly different, helping to pinpoint where
          the differences lie among multiple groups.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Assumptions</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The samples from each population are independent.</li>
          <li>The data are categorical.</li>
          <li>The sample size is sufficiently large for the Chi-Square distribution
            to be an appropriate approximation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Applications:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Marketing Research</strong>: To compare proportions of customer
            preferences across different demographic groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical Studies</strong>: To compare treatment success rates across
            different treatment groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Sociological Research</strong>: To examine differences in proportions
            of responses to survey questions across different social groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limitations:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The procedure requires a large sample size for accurate results.</li>
          <li>It only applies to categorical data.</li>
          <li>If many comparisons are made, the risk of Type I error (false positive)
            increases, although the Marascuilo procedure does control for this to some
            extent.</li>
