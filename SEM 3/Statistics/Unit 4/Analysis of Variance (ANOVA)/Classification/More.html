        <p style="margin-left:0px;">"One-way ANOVA" and "Two-way ANOVA" are both statistical methods used
          to analyze the differences among group means in a sample. However, they
          differ in terms of the number of independent variables they can handle
          and the type of effects they can test.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>One-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Used when comparing the means of three or more
            independent (unrelated) groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Independent Variables</strong>: Only one independent variable
            or factor.</li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Testing the effect of different diets (vegetarian,
            vegan, omnivore) on weight loss.</li>
          <li><strong>Analysis Focus</strong>: Determines whether there is a statistically
            significant difference among the group means.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Two-way ANOVA</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Extends the one-way ANOVA by not just looking
            at one factor but two independent variables simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Independent Variables</strong>: Two independent variables or factors.</li>
          <li><strong>Interaction Effects</strong>: Can test for interaction effects
            between the two variables, which is not possible in one-way ANOVA.</li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Testing the effect of diet (vegetarian, vegan,
            omnivore) and exercise routine (low, medium, high intensity) on weight
            loss.</li>
          <li><strong>Analysis Focus</strong>: Determines if there are any significant
            differences due to the independent variables themselves (main effects)
            and if there is an interaction effect between these variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In summary, the key difference is that one-way ANOVA looks at the effect
          of one factor on a dependent variable, while two-way ANOVA examines the
          impact of two factors and their interaction on a dependent variable. This
          makes two-way ANOVA more complex and informative in scenarios where multiple
          factors might influence the outcome.</p>
