       <h1>Classification</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) can be classified into one-way and two-way
          ANOVA, and each serves different purposes based on the experimental design.</p>
        <h3
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. One-Way ANOVA:</strong>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Scenario:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Single Factor:</strong> One independent variable (factor) is considered.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Levels (Groups):</strong> There are three or more levels
              (groups) within the independent variable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A researcher investigates the effect of different teaching methods (independent
              variable with three levels: Method A, Method B, Method C) on student performance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Points:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong> The means of all groups are equal.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):</strong> At least one group mean is
              different.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Statistic:</strong> F-ratio, comparing variability between
              groups to variability within groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Degrees of Freedom:</strong> One for between-group variance and
              one for within-group variance.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-hoc Tests:</strong> Used to identify which groups are different
              if the ANOVA indicates a significant difference.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. Two-Way ANOVA:</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Scenario:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Two Independent Variables (Factors):</strong> The effects of two
              independent variables are examined.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction Effect:</strong> Investigates whether there is an interaction
              between the two factors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A study examines the impact of both teaching method (Factor A: Method
              A, Method B) and student gender (Factor B: Male, Female) on student performance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Points:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong> The means are equal for all groups
              and there is no interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):</strong> At least one main effect
              or interaction effect exists.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Statistic:</strong> F-ratio, assessing variability between
              groups, variability within groups, and interaction effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Degrees of Freedom:</strong> Different degrees of freedom for main
              effects and interaction effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-hoc Tests:</strong> Used for specific comparisons if significant
              differences are found.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Differences:</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Number of Factors:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One-Way ANOVA has one independent variable (factor).</li>
            <li>Two-Way ANOVA involves two independent variables.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interaction Effect:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One-Way ANOVA does not assess interaction effects.</li>
            <li>Two-Way ANOVA examines whether there is an interaction between the two
              factors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Design Complexity:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One-Way ANOVA is simpler and suitable when only one factor is of interest.</li>
            <li>Two-Way ANOVA is more complex and suitable when studying the simultaneous
              effects of two factors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Degrees of Freedom:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One-Way ANOVA has one degree of freedom for between-group and one for
              within-group.</li>
            <li>Two-Way ANOVA has different degrees of freedom for main effects and interaction
              effects.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Both one-way and two-way ANOVA are powerful tools for analyzing experimental
            data, but researchers choose between them based on the specific research
            question and experimental design. The choice often depends on the complexity
            of the factors under investigation and the relationships between them.</p>
