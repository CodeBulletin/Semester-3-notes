      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical technique used to
          examine the effects of two independent categorical variables (factors)
          on a continuous dependent variable. This method not only assesses the main
          effects of each independent variable but also investigates the interaction
          effect between them.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Concepts of Two-way ANOVA:</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Independent Variables (Factors)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In two-way ANOVA, there are two independent variables, each with different
            levels or categories.</li>
          <li>For example, an experiment might investigate the effects of fertilizer
            type (Factor A) and watering frequency (Factor B) on plant growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Dependent Variable</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The outcome or response variable is continuous.</li>
          <li>In the above example, it would be the growth rate or size of the plants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Main Effects and Interaction Effect</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Main Effects</strong>: The separate impact of each independent
            variable on the dependent variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Interaction Effect</strong>: Occurs when the effect of one independent
            variable on the dependent variable depends on the level of the other independent
            variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Null Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ol>
              <li>There is no main effect of the first factor.</li>
              <li>There is no main effect of the second factor.</li>
              <li>There is no interaction effect between the factors.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Alternative Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Corresponding to each null hypothesis, stating that there is a significant
                effect.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>ANOVA Table</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The results are typically presented in an ANOVA table, which includes
            the F-statistic and p-value for each source of variation (each factor and
            the interaction).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Assumptions</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Observations are independent of each other.</li>
          <li><strong>Normality</strong>: The residuals for the group combinations should
            be normally distributed.</li>
          <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variances</strong>: The variances in different
            groups should be approximately equal (homoscedasticity).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct the test using statistical software, which provides F-statistics
            and p-values for each main effect and the interaction effect.</li>
          <li>If significant effects are found, post-hoc tests or interaction plots
            can be used to explore these effects further.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interpretation</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Main Effects</strong>: Determine if each factor has a significant
            impact on the dependent variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Interaction Effect</strong>: Investigate if the impact of one
            factor depends on the level of the other factor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Applications:</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Two-way ANOVA is widely used in experimental designs across various fields,
          such as psychology, medicine, biology, marketing, and social sciences.
          It allows researchers to understand not only the individual effects of
          different variables but also how they interact with each other, which is
          critical for complex experimental designs.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limitations:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The interpretation can become complicated, especially with significant
            interaction effects.</li>
          <li>It requires a reasonably large sample size to detect effects reliably.</li>
          <li>Like all ANOVAs, it is sensitive to the assumptions of normality and homogeneity
            of variances.</li>
