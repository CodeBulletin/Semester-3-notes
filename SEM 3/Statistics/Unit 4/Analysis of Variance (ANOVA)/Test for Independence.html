       <h1>Test for Independence</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Chi-Square Test for Independence, also known as the Chi-Square Test
          of Association, is a statistical method used to determine if there is a
          significant association between two categorical variables. This test is
          widely used in various fields like social sciences, marketing, healthcare,
          and other areas where understanding relationships between categorical variables
          is important.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Concepts of the Test for Independence:</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Purpose</strong>: The main goal is to assess whether there's an
          association or relationship between two categorical variables in a population.
          It tests whether the variables are independent (not related) or dependent
          (related).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Chi-Square Statistic</strong>: The test uses the Chi-Square statistic,
          calculated as:</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(\chi^2= \sum \sum \frac {(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O_ij\)</span>&nbsp;is the observed
          frequency in each cell of the contingency table, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(E_{ij}\)</span>&nbsp;is
          the expected frequency, calculated under the assumption that the variables
          are independent.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Degrees of Freedom</strong>: The degrees of freedom for this test
          are determined by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((\text{number&nbsp;of&nbsp;rows}−1)×(\text{number&nbsp;of&nbsp;columns}−1)\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Assumptions</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The data should be in a frequency format (counts of categories).</li>
          <li>The samples are independent of each other.</li>
          <li>Expected frequencies should be reasonably high (typically, at least 5).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (<span class="math-tex">\(H_0\)</span>​): The two variables
                are independent (no association).</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (<span class="math-tex">\(H_a\)</span>​): The two
                variables are not independent (there is an association).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Create a contingency table to observe the frequency
            distribution of variables.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Calculate expected frequencies and the Chi-Square
            statistic.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Determine the critical value from the Chi-Square
            distribution for the chosen level of significance and degrees of freedom.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Compare the calculated Chi-Square statistic with
            the critical value and make a decision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interpretation</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reject&nbsp;</strong><span class="math-tex">\(H_0\)</span><strong>​</strong>:
            If the calculated Chi-Square is greater than the critical value, conclude
            that there is a significant association between the variables.</li>
          <li><strong>Fail to Reject&nbsp;</strong><span class="math-tex">\(H_0\)</span><strong>​</strong>:
            If the calculated Chi-Square is less than or equal to the critical value,
            conclude that there is no significant evidence of association.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Applications:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Social Sciences</strong>: Studying the relationship between demographic
            factors and opinions or behaviors.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Research</strong>: Understanding consumer behavior across
            different demographic segments.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical Research</strong>: Investigating the association between
            risk factors and diseases.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Limitations:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It cannot measure the strength of an association, only its existence.</li>
          <li>Large sample sizes can lead to significant results for even trivial associations.</li>
          <li>Assumes that the observations are independent and the data are categorical.</li>
        </ul>
