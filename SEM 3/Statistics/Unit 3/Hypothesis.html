       <h1>Hypothesis</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A hypothesis is a specific, testable statement or educated guess that
          proposes a relationship between variables or makes a prediction about a
          particular event or phenomenon. Hypotheses are a fundamental component
          of the scientific method and are used in various research fields, including
          science, social sciences, and statistics.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of a hypothesis include:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Testability</strong>: A hypothesis must be formulated in a way
          that allows it to be tested through observation, experimentation, or data
          analysis. It should be possible to collect evidence to either support or
          refute the hypothesis.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Falsifiability</strong>: A good hypothesis should be capable of
          being proven false. In other words, it should be possible to conceive of
          a situation where the hypothesis does not hold. This is important for the
          scientific method, which relies on testing and potentially rejecting hypotheses.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Specificity</strong>: A hypothesis should be clear and specific,
          avoiding vague or ambiguous language. It should precisely state the variables
          being studied and the expected relationship between them.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Empirical Basis</strong>: Hypotheses are based on existing knowledge,
            theories, or observations. They should be grounded in evidence and logical
            reasoning.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Predictive Nature</strong>: Hypotheses often make predictions
            about the outcome of experiments or the relationships between variables.
            This helps guide research and provides a way to evaluate the hypothesis.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Two Parts</strong>: In many cases, a hypothesis consists of two
            parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0)</strong>: The null hypothesis represents
                the default position, suggesting no effect or no relationship between variables.
                It is often what the researcher aims to test against.</li>
              <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha)</strong>: The alternative hypothesis
                is the researcher's proposed statement, suggesting a specific effect or
                relationship between variables.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">For example, in the field of medicine, if researchers want to test a new
              drug's effectiveness in reducing blood pressure, they might formulate hypotheses
              as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0)</strong>: "The new drug has no effect on
                reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertension."</li>
              <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1)</strong>: "The new drug reduces blood
                pressure in patients with hypertension."</li>
            </ul>
