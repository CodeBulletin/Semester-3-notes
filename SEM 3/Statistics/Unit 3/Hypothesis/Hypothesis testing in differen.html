       <h1>Hypothesis testing in different cases</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical technique used in various
          research and scientific fields to make decisions based on data and draw
          conclusions about populations. The application of hypothesis testing can
          vary depending on the research question and the nature of the data. Here
          are some common cases in which hypothesis testing is used:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparing Two Population Means</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Is there a significant difference
            between the means of two populations?</li>
          <li><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): The means of the two populations are equal.</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The means of the two populations are not
                equal.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Testing whether a new teaching method improves
            student performance by comparing the average test scores of two groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparing Paired Observations</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Is there a significant difference
            between two related variables (e.g., before and after a treatment)?</li>
          <li><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the paired
                observations.</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference between
                the paired observations.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Assessing whether a weight loss program leads
            to a significant reduction in participants' weight by comparing their weights
            before and after the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparing Population Proportions</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Is there a significant difference
            in the proportions of two or more categories in a population?</li>
          <li><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): The proportions are equal.</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The proportions are not equal.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Examining whether the proportions of males and
            females who purchase a product differ significantly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Goodness-of-Fit Test</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Does a sample of data fit a specific
            expected distribution or model?</li>
          <li><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): The observed data fit the expected distribution
                or model.</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The observed data do not fit the expected
                distribution or model.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Assessing whether observed data on the outcomes
            of a six-sided die follow the expected uniform distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Do three or more group means differ
            significantly from each other?</li>
          <li><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): All group means are equal.</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): At least one group mean is different.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Testing if there is a significant difference
            in the average income levels among residents in different neighborhoods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Chi-Squared Test</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Is there a significant association
            or independence between two categorical variables?</li>
          <li><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between the variables.</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is an association between the variables.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Investigating whether there is a relationship
            between smoking status (smoker, non-smoker) and the occurrence of lung
            cancer (yes, no).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Regression Analysis</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: Is there a significant relationship
            between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable?</li>
          <li><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between the independent
                variables and the dependent variable.</li>
              <li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a relationship between the independent
                variables and the dependent variable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>: Assessing the influence of factors like age
            and education on income levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Nonparametric Tests</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In cases where data do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests (e.g.,
            normal distribution), nonparametric tests like the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
            or Kruskal-Wallis test may be used.</li>
