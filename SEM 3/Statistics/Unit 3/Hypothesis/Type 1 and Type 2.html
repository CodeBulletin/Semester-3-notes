        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, Type I and Type II errors
          are two different types of mistakes that can occur when making decisions
          based on data and hypothesis tests. These errors are associated with the
          acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis (H0) in the context of a
          statistical test.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Type I Error (False Positive, α)</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is incorrectly rejected
                when it is, in fact, true.</li>
              <li>In other words, it's a false positive or a "false alarm."</li>
              <li>This error is also known as the significance level (α), and it represents
                the probability of making a Type I error.</li>
              <li>In statistical terms, it means that you conclude there is a significant
                effect, relationship, or difference when there isn't one.</li>
              <li>The probability of committing a Type I error is typically set as the significance
                level (α) and is controlled by the researcher. Common values for α are
                0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Example: Concluding that a new drug is effective when, in reality, it
          has no effect.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong>Type II Error (False Negative, β)</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is incorrectly not
                rejected when it is, in fact, false.</li>
              <li>It's a false negative or a "missed opportunity."</li>
              <li>This error is also represented by the probability β (beta).</li>
              <li>In statistical terms, it means that you fail to detect a significant effect,
                relationship, or difference when it actually exists.</li>
              <li>The probability of committing a Type II error depends on factors such
                as sample size, the effect size, and the significance level (α).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Example: Failing to conclude that a new drug is effective when it does
          have a positive effect.</p>
