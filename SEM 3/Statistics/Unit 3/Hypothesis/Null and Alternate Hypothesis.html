       <h1>Null and Alternate Hypothesis</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The null hypothesis (often denoted as H0) and the alternative hypothesis
          (H1 or Ha) are key components in hypothesis testing, a fundamental concept
          in statistics and scientific research. These hypotheses are used to make
          statements about the relationship between variables, the impact of a treatment,
          or the outcome of an experiment. They represent different scenarios and
          are subjected to empirical testing to reach conclusions.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The null hypothesis is the default assumption that there is no significant
            effect, relationship, or difference between variables.</li>
          <li>It represents the status quo, a baseline, or a state of no change.</li>
          <li>Researchers typically set up the null hypothesis as the hypothesis to
            be tested, and they aim to determine whether there is enough evidence to
            reject it.</li>
          <li>In terms of a relationship between variables, the null hypothesis often
            posits that population parameters (e.g., means, proportions) are equal
            or that there is no association.</li>
          <li>In a drug efficacy study, the null hypothesis might state that "the new
            drug has no effect on reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertension."</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts or challenges
            the null hypothesis. It proposes a specific effect, relationship, or difference
            that researchers are interested in testing.</li>
          <li>It represents what researchers are trying to demonstrate or provide evidence
            for.</li>
          <li>The alternative hypothesis may be directional (indicating the direction
            of the effect) or non-directional (simply suggesting a difference exists).</li>
          <li>In the drug efficacy study, the alternative hypothesis might state that
            "the new drug reduces blood pressure in patients with hypertension."</li>
        </ul>
