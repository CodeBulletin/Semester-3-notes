       <h1>Sample Distribution</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>A sampling distribution refers to the distribution of a statistic (such
          as the mean or proportion) calculated from multiple samples of the same
          size drawn from a population. It provides information about the variability
          and characteristics of the statistic across different samples.</p>
        <p>When it comes to large and small sample tests, it typically refers to
          the size of the samples used in hypothesis testing or statistical inference.
          Here's a brief explanation of each:</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Large Sample Test</strong> (</span>
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(n \ge 30\)</span><span class="text-big">)</span>: A large sample test
            refers to hypothesis testing or statistical inference conducted using a
            sample size that is considered large. In this context, "large" generally
            means that the sample size is sufficiently large enough to satisfy certain
            assumptions and approximations.</p>
        <p>When the sample size is large, the sampling distribution of the statistic
          tends to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population
          distribution. This is known as the Central Limit Theorem. As a result,
          statistical tests and confidence intervals can be based on the assumption
          of a normal distribution, allowing for more straightforward calculations
          and interpretations.</p>
        <p>Large sample tests are commonly used in practice when the sample size
          is reasonably large, typically greater than 30. They provide reliable results
          and are often preferred due to the simplicity and robustness of the normal
          distribution assumption.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Small Sample Test</strong> (</span>
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(n \lt 30\)</span><span class="text-big">)</span>: A small sample test
            refers to hypothesis testing or statistical inference conducted using a
            sample size that is considered small. In this context, "small" generally
            means that the sample size is relatively small, typically less than 30.</p>
        <p>When the sample size is small, the sampling distribution of the statistic
          may not necessarily follow a normal distribution. In such cases, statistical
          tests and confidence intervals may need to rely on alternative distributions
          or non-parametric methods that do not assume a specific distribution.</p>
        <p>Small sample tests require careful consideration and may involve more
          complex calculations or specialized techniques. They are often used when
          the sample size is limited due to practical constraints or when dealing
          with rare populations.</p>
