       <h1>Confidence Interval for Estimating Population Mean µ when σ is Unknown / t-satistics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>When the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown, you can estimate
          the population mean (µ) using a confidence interval based on the sample
          standard deviation (s) and the t-distribution. This method is used when
          you have a sample from the population but don't know the true population
          standard deviation. Here's how to calculate a confidence interval for µ
          when σ is unknown:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Collect Data</strong>: Start by collecting a random sample from
          the population of interest. The sample should be random to ensure it is
          representative of the population.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Determine Confidence Level</strong>: Decide on the confidence
          level you want for your estimate. Common choices are 90%, 95%, and 99%,
          but you can select any confidence level based on your requirements.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Calculate Sample Mean and Sample Standard Deviation</strong>:
          Compute the sample mean (x̄) and the sample standard deviation (s) from
          your sample data.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Determine the Degrees of Freedom (df)</strong>: The degrees of
            freedom are based on the sample size (n) and are used when working with
            the t-distribution. The formula for degrees of freedom in this context
            is (n - 1).</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Find the Critical Value (t)</strong><i>: The critical value (t</i>)
            is obtained from the t-distribution table or a statistical calculator,
            based on the chosen confidence level and degrees of freedom. For a 95%
            confidence level and n degrees of freedom, you typically find the t* value.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Calculate the Standard Error (SE)</strong>: The standard error
            is a measure of the variation in your estimate. It's calculated as:</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;">SE = s / √n</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Calculate the Margin of Error (ME)</strong>: The margin of error
                quantifies the range within which you expect the population mean to fall.
                It is computed as:</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">ME = t* * (SE)</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Construct the Confidence Interval</strong>: Use the sample mean
                (x̄) and the margin of error (ME) to create the confidence interval:</p>
              <p
              style="margin-left:0px;">Confidence Interval = x̄ ± ME</p>
