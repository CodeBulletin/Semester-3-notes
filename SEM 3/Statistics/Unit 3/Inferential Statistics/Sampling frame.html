       <h1>Sampling frame</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>A sampling frame refers to a list or a set of individuals, items, or elements
          from which a sample is drawn. It serves as a representation of the target
          population from which the sample is selected. The sampling frame should
          ideally include all the members of the population being studied and should
          be well-defined and accessible.</p>
        <p>The quality of a sampling frame is crucial because it determines the extent
          to which the sample represents the population accurately. If the sampling
          frame is incomplete or contains inaccuracies, it may introduce bias into
          the sample, leading to results that do not accurately reflect the population.</p>
        <p>Sampling frames can take various forms depending on the nature of the
          study. For example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>List-based sampling frame</strong>: This involves using a pre-existing
            list or database that contains the names, addresses, or other relevant
            information of the population members. Examples include telephone directories,
            voter registration lists, or employee databases.</li>
          <li><strong>Geographic sampling frame</strong>: In studies that focus on specific
            geographical areas, such as neighborhoods or cities, a geographic sampling
            frame can be used. This frame typically includes all the addresses or geographic
            units within the target area.</li>
          <li><strong>Random digit dialing</strong>: This method is commonly used in
            telephone surveys. It involves generating random phone numbers and using
            them as the sampling frame. However, it is important to note that this
            method may exclude individuals without landline or mobile phone access.</li>
          <li><strong>Stratified sampling frame</strong>: In some cases, the population
            may be divided into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics
            (e.g., age, gender, income). The sampling frame would then consist of lists
            or databases specific to each stratum.</li>
        </ol>
