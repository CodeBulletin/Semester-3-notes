       <h1>Random sampling and non-random sampling</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Random sampling and non-random sampling are two broad categories of sampling
          methods used in statistics. Here's an overview of each:</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Random Sampling</strong></span>: Random
          sampling involves selecting individuals or items from a population in a
          way that gives each member an equal chance of being included in the sample.
          This method relies on chance and randomness to ensure that the sample is
          representative of the population. Random sampling methods include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Simple Random Sampling</strong>: Each member of the population
            has an equal probability of being selected. This can be done using techniques
            like random number generators or lottery methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Systematic Sampling</strong>: In this method, the population is
            ordered, and every nth individual is selected to be part of the sample.
            The starting point is randomly determined.</li>
          <li><strong>Stratified Random Sampling</strong>: The population is divided
            into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics, and random samples
            are taken from each stratum in proportion to their representation in the
            population.</li>
          <li><strong>Cluster Sampling</strong>: The population is divided into clusters
            or groups, and a random sample of clusters is selected. All individuals
            within the selected clusters are included in the sample.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Random sampling methods help ensure that the sample is unbiased and representative
          of the population, allowing for generalizations and inferences to be made.</p>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>Non-Random Sampling</strong></span>: Non-random
          sampling methods involve selecting individuals or items from a population
          using non-random techniques. These methods do not provide every member
          of the population with an equal chance of being included in the sample.
          Non-random sampling methods include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Convenience Sampling</strong>: Individuals or items are selected
            based on their easy accessibility or convenience. This method is often
            used for practical reasons but may introduce bias as it may not represent
            the entire population.</li>
          <li><strong>Purposive Sampling</strong>: Specific individuals or items are
            selected based on predetermined criteria or the researcher's judgment.
            This method is used when certain characteristics or expertise are required
            for the study.</li>
          <li><strong>Snowball Sampling</strong>: Initially, a small group of individuals
            is selected, and then additional participants are identified and recruited
            through referrals from the initial participants. This method is often used
            when studying hard-to-reach populations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Non-random sampling methods can be useful in certain situations, such
          as exploratory research or when studying specific subgroups. However, they
          may introduce bias and limit the generalizability of the findings to the
          larger population.</p>
