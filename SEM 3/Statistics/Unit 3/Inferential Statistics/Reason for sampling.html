       <h1>Reason for sampling</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Sampling is a technique used in statistics to select a subset of individuals
          or items from a larger population. There are several reasons for using
          sampling:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Practicality</strong>: In many cases, it is not feasible or practical
            to collect data from an entire population due to factors such as time,
            cost, or accessibility. Sampling allows researchers to gather information
            from a smaller, more manageable subset of the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong>: Conducting a study or survey on an
            entire population can be expensive. By using sampling, researchers can
            reduce costs by collecting data from a representative sample instead of
            the entire population.</li>
          <li><strong>Time efficiency</strong>: Collecting data from an entire population
            can be time-consuming. Sampling allows researchers to obtain results more
            quickly by focusing on a smaller subset of the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: When done correctly, sampling can provide accurate
            and reliable estimates of population characteristics. By using appropriate
            sampling techniques, researchers can ensure that the selected sample is
            representative of the population, allowing for valid inferences to be made.</li>
          <li><strong>Feasibility of data collection</strong>: In some cases, it may
            be difficult or impossible to collect data from the entire population.
            For example, when studying rare diseases or inaccessible populations, sampling
            provides a practical way to gather information.</li>
