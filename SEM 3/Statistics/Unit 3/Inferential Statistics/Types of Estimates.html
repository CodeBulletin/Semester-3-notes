       <h1>Types of Estimates</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In statistics, there are various types of estimates that are used to make
          inferences about population parameters based on sample data. These estimates
          help us draw conclusions about the characteristics of a population when
          it is not feasible to measure the entire population. Here are some common
          types of estimates:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Point Estimates</strong>: Point estimates provide a single value
          as an estimate of the population parameter. They are typically computed
          from sample data. Examples include the sample mean (for estimating the
          population mean) or the sample proportion (for estimating the population
          proportion). Point estimates give a specific value, but they don't provide
          a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimate.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interval Estimates (Confidence Intervals)</strong>: Interval estimates,
          often referred to as confidence intervals, provide a range of values within
          which the population parameter is likely to fall. Confidence intervals
          include both a point estimate and a margin of error. For example, a 95%
          confidence interval for the population mean might be [60, 70], indicating
          that we are 95% confident the population mean falls between 60 and 70.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Prediction Intervals</strong>: Prediction intervals are used in
          regression analysis to estimate the range within which a future observation
          will fall. They provide a range that takes into account both the variability
          in the data and the variability associated with making predictions.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interval Estimates for Variance</strong>: In addition to estimating
            population means, statistics also estimate population variances. Confidence
            intervals for variances provide a range within which the population variance
            is expected to lie.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Quantile Estimates</strong>: Quantile estimates, like median and
              quartiles, are used to estimate population percentiles. For instance, the
              sample median is an estimate of the population median, which represents
              the 50th percentile.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE)</strong>: Maximum Likelihood
              Estimates are used to estimate parameters in statistical models. The MLE
              is the set of parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, making
              the observed data the most probable under the assumed statistical model.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bayesian Estimates</strong>: Bayesian estimation involves using
              Bayes' theorem to update prior beliefs with new data, resulting in posterior
              estimates of parameters. Bayesian estimates provide a distribution of parameter
              values, rather than a single point estimate.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Robust Estimates</strong>: Robust estimates are used to make parameter
                estimates that are less sensitive to outliers or violations of distributional
                assumptions. Examples include the median (as a robust alternative to the
                mean) and the Winsorized mean.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Non-parametric Estimates</strong>: Non-parametric estimates are
                used when assumptions about the population distribution are uncertain or
                cannot be met. Examples include the use of rank-based methods like the
                Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bootstrapping Estimates</strong>: Bootstrapping is a resampling
                technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic, allowing
                for the calculation of confidence intervals and other statistics without
                making strong parametric assumptions.</p>
