       <h1>Central Limit Theorem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics
          and probability theory. It states that, under certain conditions, the distribution
          of the sum (or the average) of a large number of independent, identically
          distributed random variables will approximate a normal distribution, regardless
          of the original distribution of the individual random variables. In other
          words, as you take more and more random samples from a population and calculate
          the mean of each sample, the distribution of those sample means will tend
          to follow a normal distribution, even if the original population is not
          normally distributed.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The key conditions for the Central Limit Theorem to apply are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Independence:</strong> The random variables being averaged or summed
            must be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one variable
            should not depend on the outcome of another.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Identically Distributed:</strong> The random variables should be
            drawn from the same probability distribution, with the same mean and standard
            deviation.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Random Sampling:</strong> The samples should be drawn randomly
            from the population, without bias.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Sufficiently Large Sample Size:</strong> The larger the sample
            size, the closer the resulting distribution of sample means will be to
            a normal distribution. There is no strict rule for what constitutes a "sufficiently
            large" sample size, but a general guideline is that a sample size of 30
            or more is often enough for the CLT to provide a good approximation to
            a normal distribution.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Central Limit Theorem is a powerful concept because it allows statisticians
          and data analysts to make various statistical inferences and conduct hypothesis
          testing, even when they don't know the exact distribution of the population.
          It's a fundamental tool for dealing with real-world data, as it often enables
          the use of normal distribution-based statistical methods.</p>
