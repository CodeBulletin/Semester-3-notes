       <h1>Inferential Statistics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that involves drawing
          conclusions or making inferences about a population based on a sample of
          data. It is used to make predictions, test hypotheses, and generalize findings
          from a smaller group (sample) to a larger population. Inferential statistics
          relies on probability theory and statistical techniques to analyze and
          interpret data, allowing researchers to make informed decisions and draw
          meaningful conclusions about the population of interest. Some common inferential
          statistical methods include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and
          regression analysis.</p>
