       <h1>Poisson Dirstribution</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that describes
          the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space.
          It is often used in situations where events happen randomly and independently,
          and the average rate of occurrence is known. The distribution is named
          after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of the Poisson distribution:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discreteness</strong>: The Poisson distribution deals with discrete
            random variables, meaning it counts the number of events that occur, such
            as the number of phone calls received in a call center in a given hour.</li>
          <li><strong>Independence</strong>: It assumes that events occur independently
            of each other within the specified interval. The occurrence of an event
            does not affect the probability of another event happening.</li>
          <li><strong>Average Rate (λ)</strong>: The Poisson distribution is defined
            by a single parameter, often denoted as λ (lambda), which represents the
            average rate of occurrence of events in the interval. This parameter determines
            the shape and characteristics of the distribution.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(P(X =x) = \frac{\mu^xe^{-\mu}}{x!}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(\sigma = \sqrt\mu\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Common applications of the Poisson distribution include modeling the number
          of accidents on a stretch of road in a given day, the number of emails
          received in an hour, the number of customers arriving at a store during
          a specific time period, and many other scenarios involving random event
          occurrences.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Poisson distribution is a useful tool in probability and statistics
          for analyzing and making predictions in situations where events occur randomly
          and independently, but the average rate of occurrence is known or estimated.</p>
