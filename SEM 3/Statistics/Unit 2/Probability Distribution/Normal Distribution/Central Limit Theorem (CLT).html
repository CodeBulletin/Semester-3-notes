       <h1>Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics
          that describes the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
          It states that, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution,
          the distribution of the sample means drawn from that population will be
          approximately normally distributed if the sample size is sufficiently large.</p>
