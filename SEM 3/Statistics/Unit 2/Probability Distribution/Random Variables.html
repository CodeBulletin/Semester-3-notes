       <h1>Random Variables</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Random variables are a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics.
          They are used to describe and model uncertain or random phenomena. A random
          variable is a variable that can take on different values as a result of
          random events or outcomes, and its value is not known with certainty until
          it is observed or measured.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are two main types of random variables:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Discrete Random Variables</strong>: These are random variables
            that can only take on a countable set of distinct values. Examples include
            the number of heads when flipping a coin multiple times, the number of
            customers arriving at a store in an hour, or the outcome of rolling a fair
            six-sided die.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Continuous Random Variables</strong>: These are random variables
            that can take on an infinite number of values within a certain range. They
            are often associated with measurements and can take any value within an
            interval. Examples include the height of individuals in a population, the
            time it takes for a computer program to run, or the temperature at a given
            location.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Random variables are typically denoted using letters such as X, Y, or
          Z. The probability distribution of a random variable describes the likelihood
          of each possible value occurring. For discrete random variables, this distribution
          is often represented by a probability mass function (PMF), while for continuous
          random variables, it is represented by a probability density function (PDF).
          The cumulative distribution function (CDF) provides the cumulative probability
          of a random variable being less than or equal to a specific value.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Random variables play a crucial role in statistical analysis, hypothesis
          testing, and making predictions in various fields, including finance, engineering,
          physics, and social sciences. They provide a formal framework for dealing
          with uncertainty and randomness in a systematic way.</p>
