       <h1>Normal Distribution</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell
          curve, is one of the most fundamental and widely used probability distributions
          in statistics. It describes the distribution of a continuous random variable
          that has certain characteristics:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Symmetry</strong>: The normal distribution is symmetric, which
            means it is shaped like a bell curve. The peak of the curve is at the mean
            (average) of the distribution, and the curve is symmetrical around this
            point.</li>
          <li><strong>Mean and Median</strong>: The mean, median, and mode of a normal
            distribution are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.</li>
          <li><strong>Bell-Shaped</strong>: The probability density function of the
            normal distribution has a single, unimodal peak, and it tapers off gradually
            as you move away from the mean. The tails of the distribution extend infinitely
            in both directions.</li>
          <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: The normal distribution is characterized
            by two parameters:
            <ul>
              <li>Mean (μ): This parameter determines the center or location of the distribution.</li>
              <li>Standard Deviation (σ): This parameter controls the spread or width of
                the distribution. Larger values of σ result in wider distributions, while
                smaller values result in narrower distributions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(P(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}*e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(P(a \le x \le b) = \int_{a}^{b}{(\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}*e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}})dx}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The normal distribution is important in statistics for several reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Many natural phenomena and measurements, such as the heights of individuals,
            test scores, and errors in measurements, tend to follow a normal distribution.</li>
          <li>The central limit theorem states that the sum (or average) of a large
            number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be
            approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution
            of those variables. This makes the normal distribution applicable in various
            statistical inference and hypothesis testing scenarios.</li>
          <li>It provides a foundation for various statistical techniques, such as hypothesis
            testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.</li>
          <li>Many statistical and machine learning models assume that the residuals
            (errors) of the model follow a normal distribution.</li>
          <li>The normal distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics and plays
            a crucial role in understanding and analyzing data in various fields of
            science, engineering, social sciences, and finance.</li>
