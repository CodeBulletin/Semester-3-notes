       <h1>Binomial Distribution </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes
          the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials
          or experiments. Each trial has only two possible outcomes: success (usually
          denoted as "S") or failure (usually denoted as "F"). The binomial distribution
          is named after the mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of the binomial distribution:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Binary Outcomes:</strong> In each trial, there are only two possible
            outcomes, often referred to as "success" and "failure." These outcomes
            are mutually exclusive.</li>
          <li><strong>Fixed Number of Trials:</strong> The binomial distribution models
            a fixed number of independent trials or experiments, denoted as "n." Each
            trial is identical in nature.</li>
          <li><strong>Constant Probability:</strong> The probability of success in each
            trial is the same and is denoted as "p." The probability of failure is
            therefore (1 - p).</li>
          <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The trials are assumed to be independent
            of each other, meaning that the outcome of one trial does not affect the
            outcome of any other trial.</li>
