       <h1>Sample Spaces</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In probability theory, a sample space, often denoted as "S," is a fundamental
          concept that represents the set of all possible outcomes or results of
          a random experiment or random process. It is a way of describing the universe
          of possible events that can occur in a given situation.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here are some key points to understand about sample spaces:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: The sample space is the set of all possible
            outcomes of a random experiment. It includes every possible result that
            could occur, no matter how likely or unlikely.</li>
          <li><strong>Notation</strong>: The sample space is typically denoted by the
            letter "S" or represented using set notation, such as {outcome1, outcome2,
            outcome3, ...}.</li>
          <li><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;
            <ul>
              <li>Consider the roll of a fair six-sided die. The sample space for this experiment
                consists of the six possible outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.</li>
              <li>Consider tossing tow coins. The Sample Space for this experiment is {HH,
                HT, TH, TT}</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Elements of the Sample Space:</strong> Each element (or outcome)
            in the sample space represents a distinct possibility that could occur
            in the random experiment.</li>
          <li><strong>Events</strong>: In probability theory, events are subsets of
            the sample space. An event is a collection of one or more outcomes from
            the sample space. For example, if we define an event "A" as the event that
            the die roll results in an even number, then A = {2, 4, 6}, which is a
            subset of the sample space.</li>
          <li><strong>Probability</strong>: The sample space is used as the basis for
            calculating probabilities. The probability of an event occurring is determined
            by the ratio of the number of outcomes favorable to the event to the total
            number of possible outcomes in the sample space.</li>
          <li><strong>Sample Space Size</strong>: The size of the sample space, often
            denoted as |S|, represents the total number of possible outcomes. In the
            case of the fair six-sided die, |S| = 6.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Sample spaces are a foundational concept in probability theory and are
          used to analyze and understand random experiments and events, enabling
          us to calculate probabilities and make predictions about uncertain outcomes.</p>
