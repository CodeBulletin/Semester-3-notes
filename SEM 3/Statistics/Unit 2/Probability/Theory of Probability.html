       <h1>Theory of Probability</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Theory of Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the
          study of random events and uncertainty. It provides a framework for quantifying
          uncertainty and making predictions in situations where outcomes are uncertain.
          Probability theory is widely used in various fields, including mathematics,
          statistics, science, economics, finance, engineering, and more.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key concepts and principles of probability theory include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Sample Space</strong>: The sample space is the set of all possible
            outcomes of a random experiment or process. It is denoted by "S."</li>
          <li><strong>Events</strong>: An event is a subset of the sample space, representing
            a particular outcome or a combination of outcomes. Events are typically
            denoted by letters like A, B, C, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Probability</strong>: Probability measures the likelihood of an
            event occurring. It is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility,
            and 1 indicates certainty. The probability of an event A is denoted by
            P(A).</li>
          <li><strong>Probability Distribution</strong>: A probability distribution
            describes how the probabilities are assigned to different outcomes in the
            sample space. Common probability distributions include the uniform distribution,
            binomial distribution, normal distribution, and Poisson distribution.</li>
          <li><strong>Conditional Probability</strong>: Conditional probability is the
            probability of an event occurring given that another event has already
            occurred. It is denoted as P(A|B), where A is the event of interest, and
            B is the condition.</li>
          <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Two events A and B are considered independent
            if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other
            event. Mathematically, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).</li>
          <li><strong>Bayes' Theorem</strong>: Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem
            in probability theory that allows us to update probabilities based on new
            information. It is often used in statistical inference and machine learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Random Variables</strong>: A random variable is a variable that
            takes on different values based on the outcomes of a random experiment.
            Random variables can be discrete or continuous, and they are characterized
            by their probability distributions.</li>
          <li><strong>Expected Value</strong>: The expected value (or mean) of a random
            variable is a measure of the central tendency of its distribution. It represents
            the average value of the variable over many repetitions of the experiment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Probability theory plays a crucial role in making decisions under uncertainty,
          conducting statistical analysis, modeling random phenomena, and solving
          problems in various fields. It has applications in areas such as gambling,
          insurance, quality control, finance, physics, biology, and more. Probability
          theory also forms the foundation of statistics, which is used to make inferences
          from data and draw conclusions about populations based on samples.</p>
