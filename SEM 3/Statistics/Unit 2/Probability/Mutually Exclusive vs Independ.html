       <h1>Mutually Exclusive vs Independent Event</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Mutually Exclusive Events:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur simultaneously,
            meaning that if one of the events happens, the other event(s) cannot occur
            at the same time.</li>
          <li>Mathematically, two events A and B are mutually exclusive if their intersection
            (the event A ∩ B) is an empty set, meaning they have no outcomes in common.</li>
          <li>Symbolically, if A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A ∩ B) = 0.</li>
          <li>For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, the events "getting an
            even number" and "getting an odd number" are mutually exclusive because
            an outcome cannot be both even and odd simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Independent Events:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Independent events are events for which the occurrence (or non-occurrence)
            of one event does not affect the probability of the other event(s) occurring.</li>
          <li>Mathematically, two events A and B are independent if the probability
            of their intersection is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.</li>
          <li>Symbolically, if A and B are independent, then P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).</li>
          <li>For example, when flipping a fair coin twice, the outcomes of the first
            flip (e.g., getting heads) do not affect the outcomes of the second flip.
            Thus, the events "getting heads on the first flip" and "getting tails on
            the second flip" are considered independent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">It's important to note that events can be one, both, or neither of these
          types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Events can be both mutually exclusive and independent if they have no
            outcomes in common and the occurrence of one event has no impact on the
            probability of the other.</li>
          <li>Events can be mutually exclusive but not independent, meaning they have
            no outcomes in common, but the occurrence of one event does affect the
            probability of the other (e.g., drawing a red card and drawing a spade
            from a standard deck of playing cards).</li>
          <li>Events can be independent but not mutually exclusive if the occurrence
            of one event does not affect the probability of the other but they can
            still happen together (e.g., rolling a die and flipping a coin; these events
            are independent because the outcome of one does not affect the other, and
            they are not mutually exclusive because they can both happen).</li>
        </ul>
