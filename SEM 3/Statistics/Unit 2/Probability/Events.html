       <h1>Events</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In probability theory, events are subsets of the sample space, where the
          sample space represents all possible outcomes of a random experiment or
          process. Events are used to describe and analyze specific occurrences or
          outcomes of interest within the context of probability. Here are some key
          points to understand about events in probability:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>: An event is a collection of one or more outcomes
          from the sample space. It represents a particular situation or condition
          that we want to study or analyze in a probability context.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Notation</strong>: Events are often denoted using capital letters,
          such as A, B, C, etc. The complement of an event A (i.e., all outcomes
          that are not in event A) is typically denoted as Ā or A' (pronounced "A
          complement" or "not A").</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sample Space (S): Consider the toss of a fair coin. The sample space is
            {Heads, Tails}.</li>
          <li>Events:
            <ul>
              <li>Event A: Getting Heads on the coin toss. A = {Heads}.</li>
              <li>Event B: Getting Tails on the coin toss. B = {Tails}.</li>
              <li>Event C: Getting either Heads or Tails. C = {Heads, Tails}.</li>
              <li>Event D: Getting neither Heads nor Tails (impossible event). D = {} or
                D = ∅.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Probability of Events</strong>: The probability of an event is
          a measure of the likelihood that the event will occur. It is calculated
          by dividing the number of outcomes favorable to the event by the total
          number of outcomes in the sample space. Mathematically, the probability
          of an event A is denoted as P(A).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Complementary Events</strong>: The complement of an event A (denoted
          as Ā or A') consists of all outcomes in the sample space that are not
          part of event A. In other words, Ā includes all outcomes that make event
          A not occur. For example, if event A is "getting a 4 on a fair six-sided
          die," then Ā is "not getting a 4," which includes outcomes {1, 2, 3, 5,
          6}.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Union and Intersection of Events</strong>: Events can be combined
          using set operations. The union of two events A and B (denoted as A ∪ B)
          represents the event that at least one of the two events occurs. The intersection
          of two events A and B (denoted as A ∩ B) represents the event that both
          events occur simultaneously.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Events in probability theory allow us to specify and analyze the likelihood
          of various outcomes or scenarios in random experiments. Probability calculations
          and concepts such as conditional probability, independence, and more are
          based on events and their relationships within the sample space.</p>
