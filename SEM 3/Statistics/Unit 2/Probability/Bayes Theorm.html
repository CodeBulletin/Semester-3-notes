       <h1>Bayes Theorm</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Bayes, is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics.
          It provides a way to update our beliefs or probabilities about an event
          based on new evidence or information. The theorem is often used in various
          fields, including statistics, machine learning, and Bayesian inference.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The basic form of Bayes' theorem is as follows:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)*P(B)}{P(A)}\)</span>
          </p>
          <p>In simple terms, Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about
            the probability of an event A happening based on the likelihood of observing
            evidence B if A were true and our initial beliefs about the probability
            of A.</p>
