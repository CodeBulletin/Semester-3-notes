       <h1>Conditional Probability</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Conditional probability is a concept in probability theory that deals
          with the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has
          already occurred or is known to have occurred. In other words, it quantifies
          the probability of one event happening under a specific condition or context.
          Conditional probability is denoted as P(A | B), where "P(A | B)" represents
          the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Here are the key components and notation associated with conditional probability:</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">P(A | B): This notation represents the conditional probability of event
            A occurring given that event B has occurred. It is read as "the probability
            of A given B."</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Formula: The formula for conditional probability is defined as: P(A |
              B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>P(A and B) represents the probability of both events A and B occurring
                simultaneously.</li>
              <li>P(B) represents the probability of event B occurring.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Interpretation: Conditional probability allows us to update our assessment
              of the probability of event A based on new information or a specific condition
              provided by the occurrence of event B.</p>
