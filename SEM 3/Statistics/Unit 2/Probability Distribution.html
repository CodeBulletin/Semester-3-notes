       <h1>Probability Distribution</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A probability distribution is a mathematical function or model that describes
          the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a random experiment or
          process. It provides a way to quantify the uncertainty or randomness associated
          with these outcomes by assigning probabilities to each possible outcome.
          Probability distributions are fundamental concepts in probability theory
          and statistics, and they are used to characterize and analyze random variables
          and processes.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are two main types of probability distributions:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Discrete Probability Distribution</strong>: In a discrete probability
          distribution, the random variable can take on a countable set of distinct
          values, often integers. Each value is associated with a probability mass
          function (PMF), which assigns a probability to that specific value. Examples
          of discrete probability distributions include the binomial distribution,
          Poisson distribution, and geometric distribution.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Binomial Distribution</strong>: Describes the number of successes
            in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments with two
            possible outcomes, such as success or failure).</li>
          <li><strong>Poisson Distribution</strong>: Models the number of events occurring
            in a fixed interval of time or space when events occur with a known average
            rate.</li>
          <li><strong>Geometric Distribution</strong>: Represents the number of trials
            needed to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli
            trials.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Continuous Probability Distribution</strong>: In a continuous
          probability distribution, the random variable can take on any value within
          a specified range. Instead of assigning probabilities to individual values,
          it assigns probabilities to intervals or ranges of values. The probability
          density function (PDF) characterizes this type of distribution. Examples
          of continuous probability distributions include the normal distribution,
          exponential distribution, and uniform distribution.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Normal Distribution</strong>: Also known as the Gaussian distribution,
            it is a symmetric bell-shaped curve that is often used to model naturally
            occurring phenomena like heights, weights, and measurement errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Exponential Distribution</strong>: Models the time between events
            occurring at a constant rate in a Poisson process, such as the time between
            arrivals of customers at a service center.</li>
          <li><strong>Uniform Distribution</strong>: Represents a constant probability
            over a continuous range of values, where all values in that range are equally
            likely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Probability distributions are essential for performing statistical analysis,
          making predictions, and understanding the behavior of random variables
          and processes. They are widely used in fields such as economics, physics,
          engineering, biology, and finance to model and analyze real-world phenomena
          that involve uncertainty.</p>
