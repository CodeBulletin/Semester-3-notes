        <h2>a) Define States Spaces in AI? Why they are useful? Write state spaces for any suitable problem?</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>: In artificial intelligence, a <strong>state space</strong> refers
          to the set of all possible states in which a problem can exist. It is a
          conceptual landscape where each point represents a unique state, a snapshot
          of the problem at a particular point in time, encapsulating all the necessary
          information to describe the situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Why They Are Useful</strong>: State spaces are essential in AI
          for several reasons:</p>
        <p><strong>Problem Representation</strong>: They provide a structured way
          to represent complex problems, making them manageable for computational
          algorithms.</p>
        <p><strong>Search and Optimization</strong>: Many AI algorithms work by searching
          through this space to find a path from an initial state to a goal state,
          or to find an optimal state according to some criteria.</p>
        <p><strong>Decision Making</strong>: In decision-making problems, state spaces
          help in visualizing and evaluating the consequences of different actions.</p>
        <p><strong>Planning and Reasoning</strong>: They are crucial in planning
          and reasoning tasks, where the objective is to find a sequence of actions
          leading from the initial state to the goal state.</p>
        <p><strong>Example of State Spaces</strong>: Consider the classic problem
          of the Tower of Hanoi. The problem involves moving a stack of different-sized
          disks from one peg to another, with a third peg available for temporary
          storage, and the rule that a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller
          disk.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The state space here consists of all possible arrangements of disks on
            the three pegs.</li>
          <li>Each state can be represented by the configuration of disks on each peg.</li>
          <li>The initial state is where all disks are stacked in size order on the
            first peg, and the goal state is to have all disks similarly stacked on
            the second or third peg.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(b) Discuss various problems in Hill Climbing Algorithm and how they can be prevented?</h2>
        <p><strong>Hill Climbing Algorithm</strong> is a heuristic search used for
          mathematical optimization problems. Despite its simplicity and efficiency,
          it faces several issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local Maxima</strong>: The algorithm may get stuck at a local
            maximum, a point that is higher than its neighbors but not the highest
            point in the state space.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Use techniques like Simulated Annealing or
                Random Restart Hill Climbing, which allow the algorithm to jump out of
                local maxima.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Plateaus</strong>: A plateau is a flat area of the search space
            where all neighboring states have the same value. The algorithm can get
            stuck here with no uphill direction.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement a more sophisticated move strategy
                that allows sideways movement or random jumps.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Ridges</strong>: These are areas where the optimum lies along
            a narrow path, but the hill-climbing algorithm may not find this path because
            it requires moving in a direction that initially seems to go downhill.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Use algorithms like Gradient Descent with momentum
                or algorithms that can take into account second-order information from
                the search space.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Global Maximum Identification</strong>: Standard hill-climbing
            might fail to differentiate between global and local maxima.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Genetic algorithms or other global search strategies
                can be employed to better explore the state space.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
