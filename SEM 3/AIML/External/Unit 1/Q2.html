       <h1>Q2</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>a) Explain the following search algorithms with example:&nbsp;<br>I) MEA<br>ii) AO*</h2>
        <h4>i) MEA (Means-Ends Analysis)</h4>
        <p><strong>MEA</strong> is a problem-solving technique used in AI that involves
          breaking down the difference between the current state and the goal state
          into smaller, more manageable differences, creating sub-goals to address
          these differences. It's a way of guiding the search in problem-solving
          by identifying the "ends" to be achieved and finding the "means" to achieve
          them.</p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider the problem of solving a Rubik's Cube.
          The goal state is a cube where each face is a single color. The current
          state is a mixed-up cube. MEA would involve:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Identifying the largest discrepancy between the current and goal states
            (e.g., a specific face not being completed).</li>
          <li>Creating a sub-goal to address this (e.g., aligning one face completely).</li>
          <li>Finding the moves (means) that reduce the discrepancy between the current
            state and the sub-goal.</li>
          <li>Repeating the process until the goal state is reached.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>ii) AO* (And-Or Graph Search Algorithm)</h4>
        <p><strong>AO</strong>* is an algorithm used in AI for searching graph structures
          that contain "and" nodes and "or" nodes. It's particularly useful for problems
          where actions have multiple outcomes (the and-nodes) and there are multiple
          actions available (the or-nodes).</p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider a scenario in game development where
          a character needs to find a treasure in a dungeon. The dungeon has rooms
          (or-nodes) with multiple paths and certain conditions (and-nodes) like
          fighting a monster or finding a key. The AO* algorithm would:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start at the initial state (entering the dungeon).</li>
          <li>Explore paths (or-nodes) while dealing with conditions (and-nodes).</li>
          <li>Keep track of the best path (least cost or most reward) to the treasure.</li>
          <li>Backtrack and explore alternate paths if a dead-end or too costly path
            is encountered, until the treasure is found.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>b) Difference between AI, ML and Deep Learning? Give Suitable Example.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>: AI is a broad field of
            computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing
            tasks that typically require human intelligence. It's the overarching discipline
            that encompasses everything from rule-based systems to learning algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:80px;"><strong>Example</strong>: A smart thermostat system that learns your preferences
          and adjusts the temperature based on the time of day, weather, and your
          presence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>: ML is a subset of AI. It refers
            to the methods that enable machines to improve at tasks with experience.
            ML algorithms use statistical methods to enable machines to improve with
            data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:80px;"><strong>Example</strong>: A recommendation system on a streaming platform
          like Netflix, which suggests movies or TV shows based on your viewing history.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: Deep Learning is a subset of ML, primarily
            concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the
            brain called artificial neural networks. It's particularly powerful for
            tasks involving large amounts of data and complex patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:80px;"><strong>Example</strong>: Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, which use
          deep neural networks for natural language processing and understanding
          human speech.</p>
        <p>In summary:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI</strong> is the broadest concept, involving machines that can
            perform tasks smartly.</li>
          <li><strong>ML</strong> is a subset of AI with algorithms that learn from and
            make predictions or decisions based on data.</li>
          <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong> is a subset of ML focused on neural networks
            and is particularly adept at learning from large datasets.</li>
