        <h2>(a) Difference between Bias and Varience?</h2>
        <p>Bias and variance are two critical concepts in machine learning that describe
          errors from different sources in predictive modeling.</p>
        <p><strong>Bias:</strong> Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic
          assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause a model to miss
          the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).
          This usually happens with models that are too simple (linear models) which
          cannot capture the complexity in the data.</p>
        <p><strong>Variance:</strong> Variance refers to the error due to too much
          complexity in the learning algorithm. High variance can cause overfitting:
          modeling the random noise in the training data, rather than the intended
          outputs. This often happens in models that are too complex (like deep neural
          networks) and learn the noise in the data as if it were a part of the pattern,
          leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.</p>
        <p>The key in machine learning is to find the right balance between bias
          and variance, minimizing the total error. This is often referred to as
          the bias-variance tradeoff.</p>
        <h2>(b) What are various types of Machine Learning's Problems?</h2>
        <p>Machine learning problems are generally classified into a few broad categories:</p>
        <p><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns from a labeled
          dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate
          its accuracy on training data. Examples include regression (predicting
          a continuous value) and classification (predicting a discrete label).</p>
        <p><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm must learn from an
          unlabeled dataset, finding structure in the data on its own. Common tasks
          include clustering (grouping similar items together) and association (discovering
          rules that capture relationships between items in data).</p>
        <p><strong>Semi-supervised Learning:</strong> This approach sits between supervised
          and unsupervised learning. The algorithm learns from a dataset that is
          partially labeled, often a small amount of labeled data with a large amount
          of unlabeled data.</p>
        <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns by interacting
          with an environment, using feedback from its own actions and experiences
          to make decisions. It's often used in areas such as robotics, gaming, and
          navigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> This is about identifying unusual patterns
          that do not conform to expected behavior. It is commonly used in fraud
          detection, system health monitoring, and outlier detection in data cleaning.</p>
        <p><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> The process of reducing the
          number of input variables in the dataset, used for both simplifying the
          model and reducing computational costs.</p>
