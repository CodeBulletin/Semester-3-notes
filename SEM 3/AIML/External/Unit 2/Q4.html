        <h2>(a) What are the various Inferences rule? Explain.</h2>
        <p><strong>Modus Ponens</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.</li>
          <li>Example: If it is raining (P), the streets will be wet (Q). It is raining.
            Therefore, the streets are wet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Modus Tollens</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: If P, then Q. Q is not true. Therefore, P is not true.</li>
          <li>Example: If it is snowing (P), it is cold outside (Q). It is not cold
            outside. Therefore, it is not snowing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Hypothetical Syllogism</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: If P, then Q. If Q, then R. Therefore, if P, then R.</li>
          <li>Example: If I study hard (P), I will pass the exam (Q). If I pass the
            exam (Q), I will graduate (R). Therefore, if I study hard (P), I will graduate
            (R).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disjunctive Syllogism</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: P or Q. Not P. Therefore, Q.</li>
          <li>Example: It is either raining (P) or snowing (Q). It is not raining. Therefore,
            it is snowing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Addition</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: P is true. Therefore, P or Q is true.</li>
          <li>Example: I am reading a book (P). Therefore, I am reading a book (P) or
            I am watching TV (Q).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Simplification</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: P and Q are true. Therefore, P is true.</li>
          <li>Example: It is raining (P) and cold (Q). Therefore, it is raining.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conjunction</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: P is true. Q is true. Therefore, P and Q are true.</li>
          <li>Example: I am hungry (P). I am tired (Q). Therefore, I am hungry and tired.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Resolution</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: P or Q. R or ¬P. Therefore, Q or R.</li>
          <li>Example: I will go for a walk (P) or read a book (Q). It will rain (R)
            or I will not go for a walk (¬P). Therefore, I will read a book (Q) or
            it will rain (R).</li>

        <h2>(b) Difference between Predicate and Propositional Logic? Provide example</h2>
        <p>Predicate logic and propositional logic are two different systems of logic
          used to analyze the structure and validity of arguments. They differ in
          their complexity and the types of statements they can handle.</p>
        <p><strong>Propositional Logic:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Focuses on propositions, which are statements that can be either true
            or false.</li>
          <li>Does not consider the internal structure of propositions.</li>
          <li>Uses logical operators like AND, OR, NOT, IF...THEN (→), and IF AND ONLY
            IF (↔) to form more complex statements.</li>
          <li>Example: Let P represent "It is raining" and Q represent "The ground is
            wet". A propositional logic statement could be "If it is raining (P), then
            the ground is wet (Q)", symbolized as P → Q.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Predicate Logic (or First-Order Logic):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extends propositional logic by dealing with predicates and quantifiers.</li>
          <li>A predicate is a function that returns a truth value. It can contain variables
            that stand for objects in a domain of discourse.</li>
          <li>Uses quantifiers such as 'for all' (∀) and 'there exists' (∃) to specify
            the scope of the variables in predicates.</li>
          <li>Example: Let P(x) be a predicate meaning "x is raining". We can have a
            statement like "For all x, if x is raining, then the ground is wet", symbolized
            as ∀x (P(x) → Q), where Q represents "The ground is wet".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, propositional logic deals with whole statements as single
          units without considering their internal structure, whereas predicate logic
          breaks down statements into predicates with variables and quantifies these
          variables. Predicate logic is more expressive and powerful, allowing for
          a finer-grained analysis of logical statements, particularly useful in
          mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.</p>
