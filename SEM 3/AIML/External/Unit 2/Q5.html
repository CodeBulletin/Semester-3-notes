        <h2>(a) What are the importance of Knowledge Representation? Explain with Example?</h2>
        <p>Knowledge representation is a crucial aspect in the field of Artificial
          Intelligence (AI) and other computational disciplines. It involves the
          way knowledge is structured, stored, and utilized in computational systems.
          Here are some key points illustrating its importance, along with examples:</p>
        <p><strong>Facilitating Reasoning and Decision Making</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge representation allows systems to make decisions or inferences
            based on the knowledge they have. For example, in a medical diagnosis system,
            knowledge about symptoms and diseases is represented in a structured format.
            This allows the system to infer potential diseases based on the symptoms
            input by the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Enabling Complex Problem Solving</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>With a structured representation of knowledge, AI systems can solve complex
            problems. For instance, in chess-playing AI, the system uses knowledge
            about chess rules, strategies, and positions to make the best moves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Improving Communication with Humans</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge representation structures knowledge in a way that can be easily
            interpreted both by computers and humans. For example, in natural language
            processing applications, knowledge about grammar and semantics is represented
            to facilitate effective communication with users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Enhancing Learning and Adaptation</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In machine learning, the way knowledge is represented can significantly
            impact the learning process. For example, in image recognition systems,
            the representation of visual features and patterns is crucial for the system
            to learn and correctly identify objects in images.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Supporting Consistency and Reducing Ambiguity</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structured knowledge representation ensures consistency in how information
            is interpreted and processed. For instance, in legal expert systems, laws
            and legal precedents are represented in a consistent format to provide
            reliable legal advice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Aiding in Knowledge Sharing and Transfer</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge representation allows for the sharing of information across
            different systems and domains. For example, in the Semantic Web, information
            is structured in a way that different web applications can understand and
            use, facilitating information sharing and interoperability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(b) Explain the difference between Forward and Backward Reasoning?</h2>
        <p>Forward reasoning and backward reasoning are two different approaches
          used in logical reasoning, particularly in artificial intelligence and
          computational logic. They differ in their direction and methodology of
          reaching conclusions from given premises or goals.</p>
        <p><strong>Forward Reasoning (or Forward Chaining):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Begins with the known facts or initial conditions and applies rules to
            infer new facts.</li>
          <li>Moves from the general to the specific.</li>
          <li>It is data-driven, meaning it uses available data to reach conclusions.</li>
          <li>Commonly used in expert systems for diagnosis or prediction.</li>
          <li>Example: In a medical diagnostic system, starting with symptoms (known
            facts), forward reasoning applies medical knowledge (rules) to infer potential
            diseases (new facts).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Backward Reasoning (or Backward Chaining):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Starts with a goal or conclusion and works backward to find the necessary
            conditions or premises that would lead to that goal.</li>
          <li>Moves from the specific to the general.</li>
          <li>It is goal-driven, meaning it starts with a hypothesis or goal and looks
            for data that supports it.</li>
          <li>Commonly used in problem-solving situations, like puzzles or planning
            tasks.</li>
          <li>Example: In a legal reasoning system, if the goal is to determine whether
            a particular action is legal (conclusion), backward reasoning involves
            looking for laws and precedents (necessary conditions) that support or
            refute the legality of that action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Direction of Reasoning</strong>: Forward reasoning moves from
            known data to new conclusions, whereas backward reasoning starts with a
            desired conclusion and works backward to find supporting data.</li>
          <li><strong>Application</strong>: Forward reasoning is often used in systems
            where all data is known and the goal is to find what conclusions can be
            derived from it. Backward reasoning is used when there is a specific goal
            or hypothesis, and the aim is to determine if and how this goal can be
            achieved based on the current data.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: In some cases, backward reasoning can be
            more efficient, especially in situations with a large database of facts
            where the goal is specific. Forward reasoning can be more efficient in
            situations where the goal is to explore all possible outcomes from a given
            set of data.</li>
