        <h2>(a) Difference between Feed Forward and Back Propagation Algorithm?</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose and Direction</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feed Forward Algorithm</strong>: This is the process where the
            input data is passed through the network from the input layer to the hidden
            layers and finally to the output layer. It is a forward movement of data
            through the network.</li>
          <li><strong>Back Propagation Algorithm</strong>: Back Propagation is used
            during training of the neural network. It is the process of tuning the
            weights of the network by propagating the error back through the network.
            This process occurs in the reverse direction, from the output back to the
            input layer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Functionality</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feed Forward</strong>: In feed forward, the goal is to obtain
            the output given the input. Each neuron processes the input (by applying
            weights and biases) and passes it to the next layer until the output layer
            is reached.</li>
          <li><strong>Back Propagation</strong>: In back propagation, the output of
            the feed forward process is compared against the desired output (ground
            truth), and the error is calculated. This error is then used to adjust
            the weights and biases of the network, so that in subsequent iterations,
            the network can produce outputs closer to the desired result.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Role in Neural Networks</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feed Forward</strong>: It is used both during training and testing
            of the network. It is the basic functionality of any neural network.</li>
          <li><strong>Back Propagation</strong>: It is used only during the training
            phase of the network to improve the accuracy of predictions by learning
            from the error in previous outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Mathematical Operations</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feed Forward</strong>: Involves linear operations (like matrix
            multiplication) and application of activation functions.</li>
          <li><strong>Back Propagation</strong>: Involves computation of gradients (using
            methods like the chain rule from calculus) and updating weights and biases
            (using methods like gradient descent).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(b) Explain Recommender system? With Suitable example?</h2>
        <p>Recommender systems are tools and techniques used for suggesting products
          or contents to users based on various inputs like user's past behavior,
          similarity with other items or users, and contextual information.</p>
        <p><strong>Types</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Collaborative Filtering</strong>: Recommends items based on user
            interaction patterns. For example, if User A and User B both liked Movie
            1 and Movie 2, and User A liked Movie 3, the system might recommend Movie
            3 to User B.</li>
          <li><strong>Content-Based Filtering</strong>: Makes recommendations by matching
            the content of the items with a user's profile. For example, if a user
            frequently watches science fiction movies, the system will recommend other
            movies of the same genre.</li>
          <li><strong>Hybrid Systems</strong>: Combine collaborative and content-based
            methods to enhance the recommendation process. For example, Netflix uses
            a hybrid system to recommend movies and TV shows based on user's watching
            habits and the content of the shows.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Example</strong>: Imagine an online bookstore:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collaborative Filtering</strong>: The system might recommend a
            book to a user because it was liked and highly rated by users who have
            similar reading patterns or preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Content-Based Filtering</strong>: If a user frequently purchases
            mystery novels, the system will recommend other books categorized under
            mystery or by the same author.</li>
          <li><strong>Hybrid Approach</strong>: The system might use both the userâ€™s
            past book purchasing history and the similarity of books (genre, author,
            themes) to make recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, recommender systems aim to personalize the user experience
          and enhance user engagement by predicting and suggesting items users are
          likely to be interested in. They are crucial in various domains like e-commerce,
          entertainment, and social media platforms.</p>
