       <h1>Q1</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) Difference between Boosting and Bagging?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p><strong>Boosting</strong> and <strong>Bagging</strong> are both ensemble
          techniques in machine learning, but they have different approaches:</p>
        <p><strong>Boosting</strong>: This method combines multiple weak learners
          (models that are slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong
          learner. Each new model is trained with a focus on the instances that previous
          models misclassified. Boosting is sequential, meaning each model builds
          on the previous ones, and it often leads to better predictive accuracy.
          However, it can also lead to overfitting if not carefully managed. Examples
          include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.</p>
        <p><strong>Bagging</strong>: Short for Bootstrap Aggregating, this technique
          involves training multiple models (typically of the same type) on different
          subsets of the training dataset. Each model gets a subset of data sampled
          with replacement (bootstrap samples). The final prediction is made by aggregating
          (averaging or voting) the predictions of each model. Bagging reduces variance
          and helps to avoid overfitting. A classic example is the Random Forest
          algorithm.</p>
        <h2>(b) Compare Over fitting and Under fitting?</h2>
        <p><strong>Overfitting</strong>: This occurs when a model learns the training
          data too well, including its noise and outliers, making it perform poorly
          on unseen data (high variance, low bias). It often happens with very complex
          models that have too many parameters relative to the number of observations.</p>
        <p><strong>Underfitting</strong>: In contrast, underfitting happens when
          a model is too simple, leading to a poor job of capturing the underlying
          patterns in the data (high bias, low variance). Such models perform poorly
          on both training and new data.</p>
        <h2>(c) Compare Depth First Search with Breath First Search?</h2>
        <p><strong>Depth First Search (DFS)</strong>: This algorithm explores as
          far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's good for situations
          where the solution is likely to be found far from the root node, and the
          search tree is wide and shallow.</p>
        <p><strong>Breadth First Search (BFS)</strong>: This algorithm explores all
          the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes
          at the next depth level. It's more suitable when the tree is deep and the
          solutions are frequently closer to the root.</p>
        <h2>(d) What is difference between informed and uninformed search?</h2>
        <p><strong>Informed Search</strong>: Also known as heuristic search, uses
          domain-specific knowledge to find solutions more efficiently. Algorithms
          like A* and Greedy Search fall into this category.</p>
        <p><strong>Uninformed Search</strong>: Also known as blind search, does not
          use any domain-specific knowledge. It searches by systematically exploring
          the search space. Examples include BFS and DFS.</p>
        <h2>(e) What is AI? Mention application of AI.</h2>
        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is the simulation of human
          intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
          Applications of AI include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Healthcare (e.g., diagnostic tools, personalized medicine)</li>
          <li>Autonomous Vehicles</li>
          <li>Voice Assistants (like Siri, Alexa)</li>
          <li>Recommendation Systems (Netflix, Amazon)</li>
          <li>Finance (algorithmic trading, fraud detection)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(f) What is constraint satisfaction Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm</strong> is a method in AI that
          solves problems by placing constraints on the possible solutions. These
          problems have a set of variables, each with a domain of values, and a set
          of constraints specifying allowable combinations of values. Algorithms
          like backtracking, constraint propagation, and heuristic search are used.</p>
        <h2>(g) What is Heuristic Search?</h2>
        <p><strong>Heuristic Search</strong> is an AI search algorithm that employs
          a heuristic for its search strategy. A heuristic is a technique designed
          to solve a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or to
          find an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact
          solution. It speeds up the process by using domain-specific knowledge to
          make educated guesses about which path to follow.</p>
        <h2>(h) What are the various types of Neural Network?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Feedforward Neural Networks</strong>: Basic type, where connections
            between nodes do not form cycles.</li>
          <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>: Great for image
            recognition and processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong>: Useful for sequence
            data like time series or natural language.</li>
          <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong>: Consist of two
            networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained together.</li>
          <li><strong>Autoencoders</strong>: Used for unsupervised learning tasks like
            dimensionality reduction or feature learning.</li>
        </ol>
