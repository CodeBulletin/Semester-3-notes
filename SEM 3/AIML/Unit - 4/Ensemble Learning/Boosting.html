       <h1>Boosting</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Boosting is an ensemble learning method enhancing machine learning accuracy
          by combining multiple weak learners (simple models) sequentially. Key aspects
          include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Sequential Training:</strong> Models are trained one after another,
            with each focusing on the errors of its predecessor. This differs from
            bagging's parallel training.</li>
          <li><strong>Weak Learners:</strong> Often simple models like one-level decision
            trees. Individually weak, they perform effectively when combined.</li>
          <li><strong>Weight Adjustment:</strong> After training, weights of data points
            are adjusted. Misclassified points gain weight, directing the next model
            to focus on these harder cases.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Model:</strong> Combines weak learners' outputs through a
            weighted vote (classification) or sum (regression).</li>
          <li><strong>Popular Algorithms:</strong> AdaBoost adjusts weights of misclassified
            points; Gradient Boosting minimizes a loss function; XGBoost, LightGBM,
            and CatBoost are optimized gradient boosting versions.</li>
          <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Generally achieves higher accuracy, even with
            simple models.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Risk of overfitting, especially with noisy
            data; more computationally intensive than parallel methods like bagging.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In summary, boosting incrementally builds complex models from simpler
          ones, focusing on correcting earlier mistakes, and is effective in various
          machine learning tasks.</p>
