      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Stacking, or "stacked generalization," is an ensemble learning technique
          that combines multiple base models (level-0 models) with a high-level model
          (meta-learner or level-1 model) to enhance prediction accuracy. The process
          involves:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Training Base Learners:</strong> Train various machine learning
            models (like decision trees, SVMs, neural networks) on the same dataset.</li>
          <li><strong>Generating Base Predictions:</strong> Use these models to predict
            on a separate dataset (holdout or validation set), creating a new dataset
            with these predictions as features.</li>
          <li><strong>Training the Meta-Learner:</strong> This high-level model is trained
            on the new dataset to learn how to optimally combine the base learners'
            predictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Prediction:</strong> Base models predict on new data, and
            the meta-learner makes the final prediction based on these.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Stacking captures the strengths of each base model, with the meta-learner
          determining the best combination, often leading to higher performance than
          any single model. However, it's complex and can risk overfitting, particularly
          with many base learners and limited training data.</p>
