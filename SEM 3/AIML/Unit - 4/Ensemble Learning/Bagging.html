       <h1>Bagging</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble learning technique
          used to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms.
          It reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Unlike boosting, which
          builds models sequentially and focuses on correcting the errors of previous
          models, bagging builds models independently and combines their outputs
          through averaging or voting. Here's an overview of how bagging works:</p>
        <p><strong>Bootstrap Sampling:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bagging involves creating multiple datasets from the original dataset
            using bootstrap sampling. In bootstrap sampling, datasets are created by
            randomly selecting observations with replacement, meaning the same observation
            can appear more than once in a dataset.</li>
          <li>Each of these datasets is then used to train a separate model.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Training Multiple Models:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple models (often of the same type) are trained in parallel, each
            on a different bootstrapped dataset.</li>
          <li>These models can be any machine learning algorithm, but decision trees
            are commonly used, particularly in the case of the Random Forest algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Aggregating Outputs:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>After training, the predictions from all models are combined. This combination
            is typically done by averaging in the case of regression problems, or by
            majority voting in the case of classification problems.</li>
          <li>The aggregate prediction is often more robust and accurate than any of
            the individual models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Advantages of Bagging:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reduces Variance:</strong> By averaging the results of multiple
            models, bagging can significantly reduce variance without increasing bias.</li>
          <li><strong>Improves Stability:</strong> It makes the model less sensitive
            to fluctuations in the training data.</li>
          <li><strong>Prevents Overfitting:</strong> Especially effective with models
            that have high variance (like decision trees).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Popular Bagging Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> Perhaps the most famous bagging algorithm,
            it uses a collection of decision trees.</li>
          <li><strong>Bagged Decision Trees:</strong> Multiple decision trees are trained
            on bootstrapped datasets and their predictions are averaged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Increased Computational Cost:</strong> Training multiple models
            can be computationally intensive.</li>
          <li><strong>Model Interpretability:</strong> While individual decision trees
            are interpretable, a collection of such trees (as in a random forest) is
            not as easy to interpret.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, bagging is a powerful ensemble technique used to improve the
          performance of machine learning models, particularly by reducing variance
          and preventing overfitting. It's particularly effective with high-variance
          models and is a staple technique in many data scientists' toolkits.</p>
