       <h1>Bagging</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble learning technique enhancing
          the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms by reducing variance
          and preventing overfitting. It differs from boosting by independently building
          models and combining their outputs. Key aspects include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Bootstrap Sampling:</strong> Creates multiple datasets from the
            original data using random selection with replacement, forming the basis
            for training separate models.</li>
          <li><strong>Training Multiple Models:</strong> Trains models in parallel on
            different bootstrapped datasets, often using decision trees (e.g., Random
            Forest).</li>
          <li><strong>Aggregating Outputs:</strong> Combines model predictions, typically
            by averaging for regression or voting for classification, leading to more
            robust and accurate predictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reduces Variance:</strong> Averages out results, lowering variance.</li>
              <li><strong>Improves Stability:</strong> Less sensitive to training data fluctuations.</li>
              <li><strong>Prevents Overfitting:</strong> Especially effective with high-variance
                models like decision trees.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Popular Algorithms:</strong> Includes Random Forest and Bagged
            Decision Trees.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Higher computational cost and reduced interpretability,
            particularly in algorithms like Random Forest.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In summary, bagging improves machine learning model performance, particularly
          useful for high-variance models, and is widely used in data science.</p>
