       <h1>Types of Neural Networks</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Neural networks come in various types, each designed for specific tasks
          or to process data in different ways. Here's an overview of some of the
          main types of neural networks:</p>
        <p><strong>Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The simplest type of artificial neural network architecture.</li>
          <li>Information moves in only one direction—forward—from the input nodes,
            through the hidden nodes (if any), and to the output nodes.</li>
          <li>There are no cycles or loops in the network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Primarily used for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as
            images.</li>
          <li>Characterized by their use of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and
            fully connected layers.</li>
          <li>Particularly effective for image recognition, image classification, and
            similar tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed for processing sequential data, such as time series or natural
            language.</li>
          <li>Capable of maintaining a 'memory' of previous inputs in their internal
            state.</li>
          <li>Common in applications like language modeling, speech recognition, and
            machine translation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.</li>
          <li>Particularly useful for classifying, processing, and making predictions
            based on time series data.</li>
          <li>Widely used in sequence prediction problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Autoencoders:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used for unsupervised learning tasks, such as feature learning and dimensionality
            reduction.</li>
          <li>An autoencoder learns to compress the input into a lower-dimensional code
            and then reconstruct the output from this representation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained
            together.</li>
          <li>The generator creates samples intended to come from the same distribution
            as the training set, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between
            real and fake samples.</li>
          <li>Used for generating realistic images, 3D models, and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses radial basis functions as activation functions.</li>
          <li>Particularly used for function approximation, time series prediction,
            and control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Modular Neural Networks:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consist of a collection of different networks working independently and
            contributing towards the output.</li>
          <li>Each network in the module makes a decision, and the final output is based
            on the combination of these decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Siamese Neural Networks:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use in tasks that involve finding the similarity or relationship between
            two comparable things.</li>
          <li>Common in applications like face recognition and signature verification.</li>
        </ul>
