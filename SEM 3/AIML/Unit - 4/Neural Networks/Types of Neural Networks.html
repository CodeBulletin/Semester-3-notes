       <h1>Types of Neural Networks</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Neural networks are designed for various tasks, with each type suited
          to specific data processing needs. Major types include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs):</strong> Simplest type, with
            information flowing one way from input to output, without cycles or loops.</li>
          <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Ideal for grid-like
            data (e.g., images), using convolutional, pooling, and fully connected
            layers, excelling in image recognition and classification.</li>
          <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Handle sequential data
            (e.g., time series, natural language), maintaining 'memory' of previous
            inputs for tasks like language modeling and speech recognition.</li>
          <li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):</strong> A type of RNN,
            adept at learning long-term dependencies, useful in sequence prediction
            problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Autoencoders:</strong> Employed for unsupervised learning tasks
            like feature learning and dimensionality reduction, focusing on input compression
            and reconstruction.</li>
          <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> Comprising two
            networks (generator and discriminator), they are used for generating realistic
            images and 3D models.</li>
          <li><strong>Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs):</strong> Utilize radial
            basis functions, commonly used for function approximation and time series
            prediction.</li>
          <li><strong>Modular Neural Networks:</strong> Incorporate multiple networks
            working independently, with each contributing to the final output.</li>
          <li><strong>Siamese Neural Networks:</strong> Employed in tasks requiring comparison
            of two similar entities, like in face recognition or signature verification.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Each neural network type is tailored to specific applications, from simple
          data flow in FNNs to complex generative tasks in GANs.</p>
