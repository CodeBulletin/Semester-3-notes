       <h1>Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) are a basic type of artificial neural
          network with a unidirectional flow of data from input to output nodes,
          without cycles or loops. Their structure includes an input layer for receiving
          data, one or more hidden layers for computations, and an output layer for
          the final result.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key features of FNNs are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layered Structure</strong>: Input layer, hidden layers for processing,
            and output layer for results.</li>
          <li><strong>Neurons and Activation Function</strong>: Connections between
            layers use neurons applying functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.</li>
          <li><strong>Weights and Biases</strong>: Adjustable weights on connections
            and biases on neurons tailor the network's output.</li>
          <li><strong>Forward Propagation</strong>: Data flows from input to output,
            with each neuron outputting a processed sum of inputs.</li>
          <li><strong>Backpropagation and Training</strong>: Uses backpropagation and
            gradient descent methods to minimize output error and adjust weights and
            biases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">FNNs excel in tasks like regression and classification but struggle with
          sequential or time-dependent data, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
          or Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) are more effective. They serve
          as a foundational concept for understanding more complex neural network
          architectures and are widely used in various machine learning problems.</p>
