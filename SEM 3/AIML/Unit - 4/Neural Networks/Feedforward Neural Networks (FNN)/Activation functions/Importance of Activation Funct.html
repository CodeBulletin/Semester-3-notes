        <p><strong>Importance of Activation Functions</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Introducing Non-Linearity</strong>: Without non-linearity, a neural
            network, regardless of how many layers it has, behaves like a single-layer
            perceptron because summing these layers would give you just another linear
            function. Non-linear functions allow neural networks to learn complex patterns
            in the data.</li>
          <li><strong>Enabling Backpropagation</strong>: They allow backpropagation
            as they have a derivative function which is used in updating the weights
            of the neural inputs.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Making</strong>: Activation functions like the sigmoid
            or softmax make it easy to classify the outputs into different classes
            and make decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Control of Neural Network Behavior</strong>: Different activation
            functions control the neural network behavior in different ways. For example,
            the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function allows models to converge
            quickly and perform better because it does not activate all neurons at
            the same time.</li>
          <li><strong>Variety of Functions for Different Purposes</strong>: There are
            different activation functions (like sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU) each
            suitable for different scenarios and types of neural networks (binary classification,
            regression, etc.).</li>
