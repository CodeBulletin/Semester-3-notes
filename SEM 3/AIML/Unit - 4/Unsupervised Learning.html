       <h1>Unsupervised Learning</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that deals with unlabeled
          data. Unlike supervised learning, where models are trained on data that
          is already annotated with the correct answers (labels), unsupervised learning
          algorithms must work with datasets that do not have these labels.</p>
        <p>Here are some key points about unsupervised learning:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discovering Hidden Patterns:</strong> The main goal of unsupervised
            learning is to discover underlying patterns, structures, or features in
            the data. Since there are no predefined labels or answers, the model tries
            to organize the data in some way by itself.</li>
          <li><strong>Types of Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Common types of unsupervised
            learning include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Grouping similar instances based on some similarity
                measure. Examples include K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.</li>
              <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Reducing the number of variables
                under consideration. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed
                Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are popular methods.</li>
              <li><strong>Association Rule Learning:</strong> Finding rules that describe
                large portions of your data, such as market basket analysis in retail.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Unsupervised learning is used in various
            domains, including anomaly detection (identifying rare items, events, or
            observations), pattern detection, clustering (like customer segmentation),
            and dimensionality reduction for visualization or simplifying data.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Since the outcomes are not as straightforward
            as in supervised learning, validating the results of unsupervised learning
            can be challenging. The algorithms can sometimes find patterns that are
            not meaningful (known as overfitting).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, unsupervised learning provides valuable insights in cases
          where labeled data is not available, and it is used to explore the structure
          or distribution of data without being guided by a specific target variable
          or outcome.</p>
