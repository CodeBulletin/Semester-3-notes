       <h1>Recommender Systems</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Recommender systems are information filtering tools used to predict a
          user's rating or preference for items, enhancing user experience in e-commerce,
          movie streaming, and music services. These systems employ various methods:</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Collaborative Filtering</strong>: Predicts interests based on
          preferences collected from many users. It has two subtypes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>User-Based</i>: Recommends items by identifying similar users.</li>
            <li><i>Item-Based</i>: Suggests items by finding similarities among items
              liked by users.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Content-Based Filtering</strong>: Recommends items using features
            of items that a user previously liked or interacted with.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Hybrid Approaches</strong>: Combine collaborative and content-based
            filtering, using various integration methods.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Knowledge-Based Systems</strong>: Recommend based on explicit
            knowledge about users and items, useful when user behavior data is sparse.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Utility-Based Systems</strong>: Suggest items based on a utility
            function reflecting the item's usefulness to a user.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Demographic-Based Systems</strong>: Provide recommendations based
              on a user's demographic data like age, gender, income, etc.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Recommender systems are key in modern digital services, employing advanced
              machine learning algorithms to handle large data volumes and improve user
              satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
