       <h1>Neural Networks</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Neural networks are a foundational element of artificial intelligence
          (AI) and machine learning, inspired by the structure and function of the
          human brain. They are designed to mimic the way humans learn and process
          information. Here's an overview of neural networks:</p>
        <p><strong>Basic Structure:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Neurons:</strong> The basic building blocks of neural networks
            are artificial neurons or nodes, which are inspired by biological neurons
            in the human brain. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes
            on its output.</li>
          <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Neurons are arranged in layers: an input layer
            to receive the input, one or more hidden layers to perform computations,
            and an output layer to produce the final result.</li>
          <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Neurons in different layers are interconnected,
            and these connections have weights that adjust as learning proceeds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How They Work:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Forward Propagation:</strong> Information moves through the network
            from the input layer to the output layer. Each neuron in a layer receives
            inputs from the neurons in the previous layer, applies a function (like
            a sigmoid or ReLU function), and passes the result to the next layer.</li>
          <li><strong>Backpropagation:</strong> This is the process by which the network
            learns. It involves adjusting the weights of connections based on the error
            of the output compared to the expected result. The network uses algorithms
            like gradient descent to minimize this error.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Types of Neural Networks:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feedforward Neural Networks:</strong> The simplest type, where
            the data moves in only one direction from input to output.</li>
          <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Particularly used
            in image recognition and processing, these networks have layers that convolve
            the input.</li>
          <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Used for sequential
            data like time series or natural language, where the output from the previous
            step is fed back into the network.</li>
          <li><strong>Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and more:</strong> Specialized
            architectures for specific tasks like unsupervised learning, data generation,
            etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Learning Process:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Neural networks learn from data through a process that involves adjusting
            the weights of connections to reduce the difference between the actual
            output and the desired output.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Neural networks are used in a wide range of applications, from image and
            speech recognition to natural language processing, game playing, autonomous
            vehicles, and much more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Challenges and Considerations:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Requirements:</strong> They often require large amounts of
            data to train effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>Computational Intensity:</strong> Training neural networks, especially
            deep networks, can be computationally intensive.</li>
          <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> Like other machine learning models, they
            can overfit the training data and perform poorly on unseen data.</li>
        </ul>
