       <h1>Scree Plot</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A Scree Plot is a visual tool in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
          determine the number of principal components to retain. Its key features
          include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>X-Axis:</strong> Represents principal components, ordered by derivation
            sequence.</li>
          <li><strong>Y-Axis:</strong> Displays the eigenvalue or variance explained
            by each component, often as a percentage of total variance.</li>
          <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Begins with the first, most variance-explaining
            component, descending in a manner resembling a scree slope.</li>
          <li><strong>Elbow Criterion:</strong> Identifies a point where variance decrease
            shifts from sharp to gradual, indicating significant components.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Purpose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Scree Plot visualizes principal component importance, aiding in deciding
            how many components to retain to capture most of the original data's variance.</li>
        </ul>
