       <h1>Scree Plot</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>A Scree Plot is a graphical tool used in Principal Component Analysis
          (PCA) and other multivariate methods to determine the number of principal
          components to keep. It's a simple line segment plot that shows the fraction
          of total variance in the data as explained or represented by each principal
          component.</p>
        <p>Key aspects of a Scree Plot include:</p>
        <p><strong>X-Axis:</strong> The x-axis of a Scree Plot represents the principal
          components. They are usually ordered by the sequence in which they are
          derived. So, the first principal component is the first point on the x-axis,
          the second principal component is the second point, and so on.</p>
        <p><strong>Y-Axis:</strong> The y-axis shows the eigenvalue or the amount
          of variance explained by each principal component. It usually represents
          either the actual eigenvalues or the percentage of total variance explained
          by each component.</p>
        <p><strong>Plot Appearance:</strong> The plot typically starts with the first
          principal component that explains the most variance and descends with each
          subsequent component. This descent often resembles a scree slope (from
          which the plot gets its name) â€” a mass of small loose stones found at the
          base of a cliff or mountain.</p>
        <p><strong>Elbow Criterion:</strong> One common method to decide how many
          principal components to retain is to look for an 'elbow' in the Scree Plot.
          This elbow represents a point where the explained variance stops decreasing
          sharply and starts to decrease more gradually. The components before this
          point are generally considered significant.</p>
        <p><strong>Purpose and Usage:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Scree Plot helps in visualizing the importance of the principal components.</li>
          <li>It aids in decision-making about how many principal components should
            be retained for analysis, ensuring that the retained components explain
            most of the variance of the original data.</li>
