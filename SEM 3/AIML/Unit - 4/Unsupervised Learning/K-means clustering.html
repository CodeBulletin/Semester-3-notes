       <h1>K-means clustering</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>K-means clustering is a popular and simple unsupervised machine learning
          algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping
          clusters. The goal is to group the data points into clusters such that
          the total within-cluster variation (or inertia) is minimized. Here are
          the key aspects of K-means clustering:</p>
        <p><strong>The Basic Idea:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In K-means clustering, you want to classify data points into a predetermined
            number of clusters (K).</li>
          <li>The algorithm assigns each data point to the cluster whose center (mean)
            is nearest. The mean of each cluster is its "centroid".</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Start by randomly assigning K points as
            cluster centers (centroids).</li>
          <li><strong>Assignment Step:</strong> Assign each data point to the nearest
            cluster center. The 'nearest' is usually defined using Euclidean distance.</li>
          <li><strong>Update Step:</strong> Recalculate the centroids as the mean of
            all data points in a cluster.</li>
          <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Repeat the assignment and update steps until
            the centroids no longer change significantly, indicating that the clusters
            are relatively stable and the algorithm has converged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Choosing K:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the challenges with K-means is determining the value of K. It's
            not always clear how many clusters should be used.</li>
          <li>Methods like the Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis, and the Gap Statistic
            are often used to estimate the optimal number of clusters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>K-means clustering is used in a wide range of applications, including
            market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, and pattern
            recognition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Strengths and Limitations:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> It's a simple and fast algorithm, especially
            effective for large datasets.</li>
          <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> It assumes spherical clusters and is sensitive
            to the initial choice of centroids. It can also struggle with clusters
            of different sizes and densities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Variants:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Variants like K-means++, which provides a smarter initialization of the
            centroids, and Mini Batch K-means, which uses small random batches of data
            to speed up computation, are often used to improve performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>K-means clustering is a fundamental method in the field of data mining
          and machine learning, known for its simplicity and efficiency. However,
          the quality of the results from K-means clustering is heavily dependent
          on the initial placement of the centroids and the value of K chosen, which
          requires careful consideration and sometimes multiple runs of the algorithm.</p>
