       <h1>K-means clustering</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dividing
          a dataset into K distinct clusters, aiming to minimize within-cluster variation.
          Key aspects include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Basic Idea:</strong> Data points are classified into K clusters.
            Points are assigned to the nearest cluster center, known as the centroid.</li>
          <li><strong>Process:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Randomly select K points as initial centroids.</li>
              <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> Assign each point to the nearest centroid,
                typically using Euclidean distance.</li>
              <li><strong>Update:</strong> Recalculate centroids as the mean of all points
                in a cluster.</li>
              <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Repeat assignment and update until centroids
                stabilize, indicating convergence.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Choosing K:</strong> The optimal number of clusters (K) can be
            estimated using methods like the Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis, or
            the Gap Statistic.</li>
          <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in market segmentation, document clustering,
            image segmentation, and pattern recognition.</li>
          <li><strong>Strengths and Limitations:</strong> Simple and fast, suitable for
            large datasets, but assumes spherical clusters and is sensitive to initial
            centroids and cluster variability.</li>
          <li><strong>Variants:</strong> K-means++ improves initial centroid placement,
            while Mini Batch K-means speeds up computation with small random data batches.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">K-means is fundamental in data mining and machine learning but requires
          careful consideration for centroid placement and K selection.</p>
