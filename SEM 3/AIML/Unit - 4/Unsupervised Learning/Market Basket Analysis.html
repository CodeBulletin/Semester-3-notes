       <h1>Market Basket Analysis</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a technique for analyzing customer purchase
          behavior by examining transaction records to find patterns in items bought
          together. Key points include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Association Rules:</strong> Identifying item pairings frequently
            bought together (e.g., bread and butter).</li>
          <li><strong>Apriori Algorithm:</strong> A common algorithm in MBA that identifies
            frequent itemsets in a database.</li>
          <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Uses 'support' (frequency of itemset appearance),
            'confidence' (likelihood of buying an item when another is bought), and
            'lift' (normalized likelihood of two items being bought together).</li>
          <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Useful in retail for product placement,
            cross-selling, and promotions. For example, placing bread near butter to
            boost sales.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Managing large datasets and interpreting rules
            with business acumen is crucial.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In essence, MBA helps retailers and marketers in product bundling, store
          layout, inventory, and targeted marketing strategies.</p>
