       <h1>Elbow Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Elbow Method is used in k-means clustering to determine the optimal
          number of clusters (k). The process includes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Computing Clustering for Various k Values:</strong> Perform k-means
            clustering for a range of k values, calculating the sum of squared distances
            from each point to its assigned center for each k.</li>
          <li><strong>Plotting Results:</strong> Plot these sums of squared distances
            against k. The plot often resembles an arm with an elbow.</li>
          <li><strong>Identifying the Elbow Point:</strong> The optimal k is at the 'elbow,'
            where increasing k does not significantly decrease the total variance.
            This point is where the plot bends.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Elbow Method is heuristic and sometimes ambiguous, particularly if
          the plot lacks a clear bend. Alternative methods like the Silhouette Method
          or the Gap Statistic are also used for determining the optimal number of
          clusters.</p>
