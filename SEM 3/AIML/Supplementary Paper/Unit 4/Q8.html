        <p>An activation function, in the context of artificial neural networks,
          is a mathematical function that determines the output of a neuron or node
          in a neural network based on its input. It is a key component of a neural
          network as it introduces non-linearity into the model. Activation functions
          enable neural networks to learn complex patterns and make them capable
          of approximating any continuous function</p>
        <h2>(b) Explain different recommender systems with example.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Recommender systems are a class of machine learning algorithms that provide
          personalized recommendations to users based on their historical preferences,
          behavior, or explicit feedback. There are several types of recommender
          systems, each with its own approach to making recommendations. Here are
          three common types of recommender systems along with examples:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Collaborative Filtering:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaborative filtering methods make recommendations by leveraging the
            behavior and preferences of a large number of users. It assumes that users
            who have interacted or rated items similarly in the past will continue
            to have similar preferences.</li>
          <li>Example: Movie Recommendations
            <ul>
              <li>Suppose User A and User B have both rated several movies similarly. If
                User A has watched and liked movies X, Y, and Z, and User B has also liked
                X, Y, and Z, then a collaborative filtering system would recommend other
                movies liked by User B but not yet watched by User A.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Content-Based Filtering:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on their profile
            and the attributes of the items. It takes into account the features of
            items and the user's preferences.</li>
          <li>Example: News Article Recommendations
            <ul>
              <li>If a user has shown an interest in political news articles, a content-based
                recommender system would recommend more political news articles based on
                the content, keywords, or topics of the articles. It considers the user's
                profile and the content features of the articles.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Hybrid Recommender Systems:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hybrid recommender systems combine multiple recommendation techniques
            to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. These systems can
            take advantage of both collaborative and content-based methods.</li>
          <li>Example: Music Recommendations
            <ul>
              <li>In a music recommendation system, a hybrid approach might combine collaborative
                filtering by considering what other users with similar tastes are listening
                to. It can also use content-based filtering by analyzing the audio features,
                lyrics, and genres of songs to make recommendations. By blending these
                methods, the system can offer a more comprehensive music discovery experience.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Matrix Factorization (Factorization Machines):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Matrix factorization models factorize user-item interaction matrices into
            lower-dimensional matrices to capture latent factors. These models are
            used in collaborative filtering to predict missing values.</li>
          <li>Example: E-commerce Product Recommendations
            <ul>
              <li>In an e-commerce context, a matrix factorization-based recommender system
                might factorize a user-product interaction matrix, where users have rated
                or purchased products. By doing this, it learns latent factors like user
                preferences and product characteristics and can recommend products based
                on those factors.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Context-Aware Recommender Systems:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Context-aware recommender systems take into account additional contextual
            information when making recommendations. This context can include user
            location, time, device, or any other relevant data.</li>
          <li>Example: Restaurant Recommendations
            <ul>
              <li>If a user is searching for a restaurant on a mobile device and the system
                knows their current location, it can recommend nearby restaurants. This
                context-aware recommendation considers the user's location as an additional
                factor in making the recommendation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Association Rules-Based Recommender Systems:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Association rules are used to identify relationships between items frequently
            purchased or viewed together. Recommender systems based on association
            rules recommend items that are frequently associated with what the user
            has chosen or viewed.</li>
          <li>Example: Online Retail Recommendations
            <ul>
              <li>If a user adds a digital camera to their shopping cart, an association
                rules-based system might recommend memory cards, camera bags, or other
                camera-related accessories based on the historical purchase patterns of
                other customers.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
