        <h2>(a) Define state spaces in AI. Why are they useful? Write state space for any suitable problem of your choice.</h2>
        <p>In AI, a state space refers to the set of all possible states that a problem
          or system can be in. It represents the different configurations or conditions
          that the problem can exhibit. State spaces are useful because they provide
          a structured representation of the problem domain, allowing AI algorithms
          to navigate and explore the problem space efficiently.</p>
        <p>For example, let's consider the problem of solving a Rubik's Cube. The
          state space for this problem would consist of all possible configurations
          of the Rubik's Cube. Each state would represent a specific arrangement
          of the cube's colored squares. By defining the state space, AI algorithms
          can systematically explore different states and search for a solution.</p>
        <h2>(b) Identify seven problem characterization by giving any example.</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Given a list of cities and the distances
          between each pair of cities, the TSP asks for the shortest possible route
          that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Is the problem decomposable into the smaller problem - <strong>No</strong>
          </li>
          <li>can solution steps be ignored or undone - <strong>No</strong>
          </li>
          <li>is the universe of the problem predictable - <strong>No</strong>
          </li>
          <li>is a good solution to the problem absolute or relative - <strong>Relative</strong>
          </li>
          <li>is the problem to the solution state or a path - <strong>path</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Is their need of knowledge in solving this problem using ai - <strong>Yes</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Does the task of solving this problem requires human intervention - <strong>No</strong>
