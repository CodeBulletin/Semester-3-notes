        <h2>(a) Compare and Contrast - AI, ML and Deep Learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) is a broad term that refers
          to the development of machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically
          require human intelligence. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and
          approaches, including machine learning and deep learning.</p>
        <p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on
          the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn
          from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
          ML algorithms are designed to automatically identify patterns and relationships
          in data, and they improve their performance over time through experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Deep Learning</strong> is a subfield of machine learning that is
          inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It involves
          the use of artificial neural networks, which are composed of interconnected
          layers of artificial neurons, to process and analyze complex patterns in
          data. Deep learning algorithms are capable of automatically learning hierarchical
          representations of data, which allows them to extract high-level features
          and make accurate predictions.</p>
