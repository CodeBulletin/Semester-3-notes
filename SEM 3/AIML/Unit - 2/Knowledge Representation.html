       <h1>Knowledge Representation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Knowledge representation is a crucial component of artificial intelligence
          and cognitive science. It involves the encoding of information in a form
          that can be used to reason, make decisions, and solve problems. Two common
          approaches to knowledge representation are Propositional Logic and First-Order
          Predicate Logic.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Propositional Logic</strong></span>: Propositional
          logic, also known as propositional calculus, is a simple form of logic
          that deals with propositions or statements. In this approach, knowledge
          is represented using atomic propositions and logical operators to connect
          them. Here are the key components of propositional logic:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Atomic Propositions:</strong> These are basic statements that are
            either true or false. They represent facts or conditions in the world.</li>
          <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> Propositional logic uses operators
            such as AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), IMPLIES (→), and IF AND ONLY IF (↔) to
            combine and manipulate propositions.</li>
          <li><strong>Truth Tables:</strong> Truth tables are used to represent the truth
            values of compound propositions based on the truth values of their constituent
            atomic propositions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>First-Order Predicate Logic</strong></span>:
          First-order predicate logic, also known as first-order logic or FOL, is
          a more expressive and versatile logic system for knowledge representation.
          It extends propositional logic by introducing variables, quantifiers, and
          predicates. Here are the key components of first-order predicate logic:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Constants and Variables:</strong> Constants represent specific
            objects or individuals, while variables can stand for any object within
            a specified domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Predicates:</strong> Predicates represent relationships or properties
            of objects. They take arguments (constants, variables) and can be used
            to make statements about the world.</li>
          <li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> First-order logic uses quantifiers, such
            as ∀ (universal quantifier) and ∃ (existential quantifier), to express
            statements about all or some objects within a domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Functions can be used to represent operations
            or relationships that produce new objects based on existing objects.</li>
          <li><strong>Connectives:</strong> Logical connectives like ∧ (AND), ∨ (OR),
            ¬ (NOT), → (IMPLIES), and ↔ (IF AND ONLY IF) are also used in first-order
            logic to build complex statements.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Each of these approaches to knowledge representation has its strengths
          and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements
          and complexities of the domain or problem being addressed.</p>
