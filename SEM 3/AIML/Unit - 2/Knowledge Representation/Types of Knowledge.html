       <h1>Types of Knowledge</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Knowledge can be categorized into various types based on different criteria,
          including its source, form, and usage. Here are some common types of knowledge:</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Explicit Knowledge:</strong> This type of knowledge is codified
          and can be easily articulated, documented, and transferred. It's typically
          found in documents, databases, textbooks, and other formal sources. Examples
          include facts, procedures, and rules.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Tacit Knowledge:</strong> Tacit knowledge is difficult to express
            in words or formalize. It is deeply rooted in personal experience, skills,
            and intuition. Tacit knowledge is often gained through practice and interaction.
            Examples include the expertise of a skilled craftsman or a seasoned chef.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Procedural Knowledge:</strong> This knowledge pertains to how to
            do something. It includes a sequence of steps or actions required to perform
            a specific task or achieve a goal. Procedural knowledge is often found
            in manuals, instructions, or standard operating procedures.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Declarative Knowledge:</strong> Declarative knowledge consists
              of statements of fact. It describes what is, was, or will be the case.
              It is often associated with explicit knowledge and includes information,
              facts, and propositions.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Conceptual Knowledge:</strong> This type of knowledge involves
              understanding abstract concepts, principles, or theories. It helps individuals
              make sense of the world and connect different pieces of information. Conceptual
              knowledge is often found in scientific theories and models.</p>
