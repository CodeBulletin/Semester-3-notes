       <h1>What is Propositional Logic</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Propositional logic, also known as propositional calculus, is a fundamental
          branch of symbolic logic focusing on truth values of statements. Key aspects
          include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Propositions</strong>: Basic true or false statements, such as
            "It is raining."</li>
          <li><strong>Logical Connectives</strong>: Tools to combine simpler statements
            into complex expressions.</li>
          <li><strong>Syntax and Semantics</strong>: Rules for forming valid expressions
            and their truth values.</li>
          <li><strong>Truth Tables</strong>: Used to evaluate the truth value of propositions
            with logical connectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Applications</strong>: Essential in mathematical logic, computer
            science, and artificial intelligence, particularly in formal verification
            and logic programming.</li>
          <li><strong>Limitations</strong>: Doesn't address quantifiers or relationships
            between objects, requiring more complex logics like first-order logic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Propositional logic serves as the foundation for understanding more advanced
          logical systems.</p>
