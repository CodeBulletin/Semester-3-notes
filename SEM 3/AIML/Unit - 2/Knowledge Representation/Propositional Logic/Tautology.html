       <h1>Tautology</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A tautology is a statement or proposition that is always true, regardless
          of the circumstances or the values of its components. In other words, a
          tautology is an expression that is true in every possible interpretation.
          It is a fundamental concept in logic and is used to describe statements
          that have no informational content because they are true by definition.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Here are a few examples of tautologies:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">"A or not A" - This statement is always true because it covers all possible
            cases. Either "A" is true, or "not A" is true, so the disjunction "A or
            not A" is a tautology.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">"If it's raining, then it's raining" - This statement is always true because
            it's essentially saying the same thing twice, and it's impossible for it
            to be false.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">"All men are mortal or not all men are mortal" - This statement is also
            a tautology because it covers all possible cases regarding the mortality
            of men.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Tautologies are commonly used in logic to establish the validity of arguments
            or to simplify logical expressions. In formal logic, they are often used
            to demonstrate the equivalence of two logical expressions or to simplify
            complex logical statements.</p>
