       <h1>Universal Quantifier </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In first-order predicate logic, the universal quantifier (∀) expresses
          that a statement applies to all elements of a specified domain. It's symbolized
          by ∀ and read as "for all," "for every," or "for each."</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key Points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Notation</strong>: Written as ∀x P(x), meaning "for every x, P(x)
            is true."</li>
          <li><strong>Meaning</strong>: Asserts that P(x) is true for every element
            x in the domain of discourse, the set of all considered objects.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope</strong>: The variable x is bound within the expression,
            focusing on the universal truth of property P across all x.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>In mathematics: ∀x (x² ≥ 0) means "for all x, x squared is greater than
                or equal to 0."</li>
              <li>In everyday language: ∀x (If x is a bird, then x has wings) translates
                to "All birds have wings."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Contrast with Existential Quantifier</strong>: Unlike the existential
            quantifier (∃), the universal quantifier applies to all elements, not just
            any one.</li>
          <li><strong>Use in Proofs</strong>: Crucial in formal logic and mathematics
            for general statements about sets or categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Understanding the universal quantifier is key in formal logic for expressing
          broad principles and theorems.</p>
