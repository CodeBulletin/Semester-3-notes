       <h1>Predicate</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>In logic and mathematics, a predicate is a statement or expression that
          can be either true or false depending on the values of its variables. Predicates
          are used to make assertions about one or more variables and are a fundamental
          concept in formal logic, mathematics, and computer science. They are often
          used to describe properties or relationships between objects or elements.</p>
