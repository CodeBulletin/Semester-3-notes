       <h1>Monotonic Reasoning</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Monotonic reasoning, also known as monotonic logic or classical logic,
          is a type of reasoning in logic and philosophy that adheres to the principle
          of monotonicity. In monotonic reasoning, the addition of new information
          or premises to an existing set of premises can only strengthen or extend
          the conclusions that can be drawn from those premises. In other words,
          as you add more true statements or facts to your knowledge base, your set
          of conclusions can only grow, never diminish. This is sometimes referred
          to as the "closed-world assumption."</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of monotonic reasoning include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Monotonicity Principle:</strong> Monotonic reasoning operates on
            the principle that if a statement or fact is true in a certain context,
            it will remain true when new information is added, and new information
            will not make previously established truths false.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Conclusions are Conserved:</strong> In monotonic reasoning, once
            a conclusion is derived from a set of premises, it remains valid even if
            more premises are added to the knowledge base. The set of valid conclusions
            is always expanded but never reduced.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Soundness:</strong> Monotonic reasoning is sound in the sense that
            if the premises are true, and the reasoning process is valid, then the
            conclusions drawn from those premises are also true.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">While monotonic reasoning is an important and well-understood form of
          logic, it has limitations, particularly in dynamic and real-world situations
          where information may be incomplete, uncertain, or subject to change. In
          such cases, non-monotonic reasoning or defeasible reasoning may be more
          appropriate. Non-monotonic reasoning allows for the revision of conclusions
          in light of new information without violating the monotonicity principle.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Non-monotonic reasoning is often used in artificial intelligence and expert
          systems, as it can better capture the complexities and uncertainties inherent
          in many real-world problems. Monotonic reasoning is useful in more straightforward,
          deductive contexts where the knowledge base is well-defined and static.</p>
