       <h1>Monotonic Reasoning</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Monotonic reasoning, or monotonic logic, is a form of logic where new
          information only strengthens or extends conclusions drawn from existing
          premises, following the "closed-world assumption."</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key Features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Monotonicity Principle</strong>: A truth remains valid with the
            addition of new information; new facts don't negate established truths.</li>
          <li><strong>Conclusions are Conserved</strong>: Once a conclusion is derived,
            it stays valid even when more premises are added, expanding the set of
            valid conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Soundness</strong>: If premises are true and reasoning is valid,
            the conclusions are also true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Limitations arise in dynamic or uncertain situations, where non-monotonic
          or defeasible reasoning, allowing for conclusion revision with new information,
          may be more suitable. Non-monotonic reasoning is often used in AI and expert
          systems to handle real-world complexities, while monotonic reasoning is
          better for straightforward, deductive contexts with a stable knowledge
          base.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Example:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Scenario: Observing Animals in a Garden</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Initial Observation and Conclusion:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Observation: You see several birds in the garden.</li>
          <li>Conclusion: "There are birds in the garden."</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Additional Information:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You then notice some squirrels in the garden as well.</li>
          <li>New Observation: There are birds and squirrels in the garden.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Monotonic Reasoning Applied:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Even with the new information (the presence of squirrels), your initial
            conclusion ("There are birds in the garden") remains true.</li>
          <li>The set of conclusions now is: "There are birds in the garden" and "There
            are squirrels in the garden."</li>
        </ul>
