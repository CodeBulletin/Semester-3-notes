       <h1>Non - Monotonic</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Non-monotonic reasoning is a type of reasoning in artificial intelligence
          and logic that allows for the revision of conclusions based on new information
          without invalidating previously drawn conclusions. In non-monotonic reasoning,
          unlike classical logic, adding additional facts or rules may lead to the
          retraction or revision of prior inferences. This approach is essential
          for handling uncertainty and incomplete information in AI systems.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Characteristics of Non-Monotonic Reasoning:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li><strong>Default Reasoning:</strong> Non-monotonic reasoning often involves
              default rules or assumptions that can be overridden or revised in the presence
              of new evidence. These defaults represent tentative conclusions that are
              assumed to be true unless contradicted.</li>
            <li><strong>Closed-World Assumption:</strong> In non-monotonic reasoning, there
              is a closed-world assumption, meaning that if a statement is not explicitly
              known to be true, it is considered false. However, this assumption can
              be overridden by default rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> When conflicts arise between default
              rules or conclusions, non-monotonic reasoning mechanisms attempt to resolve
              these conflicts by taking into account the specificity or reliability of
              the information.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Example of Non-Monotonic Reasoning:</strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Consider a non-monotonic reasoning scenario involving a bird classification
            system. We have the following default rules:</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li>If an animal has feathers, it is classified as a bird (default assumption).</li>
            <li>If an animal can fly, it is classified as a bird (default assumption).</li>
            <li>Penguins have feathers, but they cannot fly (specific information).</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Now, let's apply non-monotonic reasoning to classify animals based on
            these rules:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>Given a generic animal X with feathers, non-monotonic reasoning would
              initially classify X as a bird based on the first rule (default assumption).</li>
            <li>However, if we encounter specific information about a penguin, which has
              feathers but cannot fly (contradicting the second rule), non-monotonic
              reasoning revises the classification for penguins. It recognizes that the
              initial assumption based on the second rule was incorrect in this specific
              case.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">So, in non-monotonic reasoning, the classification of penguins as birds
            is revised or overridden when we encounter the specific information that
            they cannot fly. This illustrates the ability of non-monotonic reasoning
            to handle exceptions and revise conclusions based on new evidence without
            violating the default assumptions entirely.</p>
