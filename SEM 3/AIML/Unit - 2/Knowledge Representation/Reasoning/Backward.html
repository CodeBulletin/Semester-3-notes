       <h1>Backward</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Backward reasoning, or backward chaining, is a strategy in artificial
          intelligence and expert systems that starts with a specific goal and works
          backward to identify necessary supporting facts, rules, or conditions.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Key features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal-Oriented</strong>: Begins with a defined goal or query.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule Application</strong>: Applies rules to the goal to find required
              supporting facts.</li>
            <li><strong>Work Backward</strong>: Traces back through rules and sub-goals
              to achieve the main goal.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop When Satisfied</strong>: Continues until known facts are
              reached or no further inference is possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Often more efficient when the goal is known
              and the focus is on finding the path to that goal.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Backward reasoning is used in expert systems, diagnostic systems, and
            other applications with well-defined goals to determine necessary conditions
            for achieving those goals.</p>
