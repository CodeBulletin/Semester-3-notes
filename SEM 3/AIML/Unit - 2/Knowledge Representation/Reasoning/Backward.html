        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Backward reasoning, also known as backward chaining, is a reasoning or
          inference strategy used in artificial intelligence, expert systems, and
          logic programming. It is a process that starts with a specific goal or
          query and works backward from that goal to identify the facts, rules, or
          conditions needed to support or achieve that goal. Backward reasoning is
          often used when you have a specific objective in mind and want to determine
          what conditions must be met to reach that objective.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of backward reasoning include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Goal-Oriented:</strong> Backward reasoning begins with a defined
            goal or query, such as a question to be answered or a problem to be solved.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Rule Application:</strong> The system applies rules or knowledge
            representations to the goal or query to determine which facts or conditions
            are required to satisfy the goal.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Work Backward:</strong> The process works backward through a chain
              of rules and sub-goals, identifying the necessary subgoals and conditions
              for achieving the main goal.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Stop When Satisfied:</strong> Backward reasoning continues until
              it reaches a point where it identifies facts or conditions that are already
              known or until it reaches an impasse where further backward inference is
              not possible.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Backward reasoning can be more efficient than
              forward reasoning in cases where the goal is known, and you want to determine
              the path to achieving it, rather than exploring all possible consequences
              of available data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Backward reasoning is commonly used in situations where the primary goal
          is to answer specific queries, make decisions, or solve problems. It is
          particularly useful in rule-based expert systems, diagnostic systems, and
          other applications where there is a well-defined goal, and the system needs
          to determine the conditions that lead to that goal.</p>
