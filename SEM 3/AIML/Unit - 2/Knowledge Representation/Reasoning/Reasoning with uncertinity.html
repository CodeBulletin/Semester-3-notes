       <h1>Reasoning with uncertinity</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Probabilistic reasoning is a method of dealing with uncertainty in information,
          making inferences based on probabilities rather than certainties. It's
          useful where information is incomplete or ambiguous.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key Features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dealing with Uncertainty</strong>: Acknowledges that situations
            often involve varying degrees of certainty.</li>
          <li><strong>Use of Probabilities</strong>: Uses numerical likelihoods for
            various outcomes, often based on statistical data, past experiences, or
            models.</li>
          <li><strong>Bayesian Reasoning</strong>: A key method, it updates probability
            estimates for hypotheses with new evidence, based on Bayes' theorem.</li>
          <li><strong>Applications</strong>: Used in AI, machine learning, statistics,
            risk assessment, medical diagnosis, and financial modeling.</li>
          <li><strong>Handling Incomplete Information</strong>: Allows decision-making
            with the best available information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Example:&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Imagine a medical diagnosis scenario where a patient shows certain symptoms.
          A doctor, using probabilistic reasoning, would consider the likelihood
          of various diseases that could cause these symptoms. If 70% of people with
          these symptoms have Disease A, 20% have Disease B, and 10% have Disease
          C, the doctor might initially lean towards Disease A. However, if a test
          rules out Disease A, the probabilities are updated, increasing the likelihood
          of Diseases B or C.</p>

        <p><strong>Need of probabilistic reasoning in AI</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>When there are unpredictable outcomes.</li>
          <li>When specifications or possibilities of predicates becomes too large to
            handle.</li>
          <li>When an unknown error occurs during an experiment.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Probability: Probability can be defined as a chance that an uncertain
          event will occur. It is the numerical measure of the likelihood that an
          event will occur. The value of probability always remains between 0 and
          1 that represent ideal uncertainties.</p>
