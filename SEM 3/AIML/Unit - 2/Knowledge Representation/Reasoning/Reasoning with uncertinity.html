        <p>Probabilistic Reasoning</p>
        <p><strong>A knowledge representation where the concept of probability is applied to indicate uncertainty.</strong>

        <p><strong>Need of probabilistic reasoning in AI</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>When there are unpredictable outcomes.</li>
          <li>When specifications or possibilities of predicates becomes too large to
            handle.</li>
          <li>When an unknown error occurs during an experiment.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Probability: Probability can be defined as a chance that an uncertain
          event will occur. It is the numerical measure of the likelihood that an
          event will occur. The value of probability always remains between 0 and
          1 that represent ideal uncertainties.</p>
