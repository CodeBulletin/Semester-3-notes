       <h1>Forward</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Forward reasoning, also known as forward chaining, is an inference strategy
          in artificial intelligence and expert systems. It begins with known facts
          and applies rules to derive new information, following a data-driven, bottom-up
          approach.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data-Driven</strong>: Starts with initial data or facts.</li>
          <li><strong>Rule Application</strong>: Applies rules to existing facts to
            derive new information.</li>
          <li><strong>Incremental Inference</strong>: Adds new facts or conclusions
            incrementally.</li>
          <li><strong>Goal-Oriented</strong>: May be driven by specific objectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Expansion</strong>: Knowledge base grows as more facts are
            added.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Used in expert systems and logic programming, forward reasoning explores
          how rules lead to new conclusions, often in problem-solving or recommendation
          scenarios.</p>
