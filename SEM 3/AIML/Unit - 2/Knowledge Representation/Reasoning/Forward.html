       <h1>Forward</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Forward reasoning is a process in artificial intelligence that finds all
          the possible solutions of a problem based on the initial data and facts.
          <br>• The forward reasoning is a data-driven task as it begins with new data.
          <br>• In forward reasoning, the first step is that the system is given one
          or more constraints.
          <br>• Forward reasoning follows the Bottom-up approach.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">
          <br>Forward reasoning, also known as forward chaining, is a reasoning or inference
          strategy used in artificial intelligence, expert systems, and logic programming.
          It is a process that starts with known facts (initial data or premises)
          and uses rules or knowledge to draw conclusions or make inferences to reach
          new facts or goals. In forward reasoning, the system begins with what is
          known and incrementally expands its knowledge base to derive new information.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of forward reasoning include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data-Driven:</strong> Forward reasoning starts with available data,
              typically represented as a set of facts or initial conditions.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Rule Application:</strong> The system applies a set of rules or
              knowledge representations to the available data. These rules define how
              new facts can be derived from existing facts or conditions.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Incremental Inference:</strong> Forward reasoning incrementally
                adds new facts or conclusions to the knowledge base based on the application
                of rules. The process continues until a specific goal is achieved, or no
                further inferences can be made.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Goal-Oriented:</strong> In some cases, forward reasoning is driven
                by specific goals or objectives. The system works towards achieving these
                goals by deriving facts that lead to the desired outcome.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Data Expansion:</strong> As the system progresses, the amount of
                information in the knowledge base typically grows, and more facts and conclusions
                are added.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Forward reasoning is commonly used in expert systems, rule-based systems,
            and logic programming languages like Prolog. It is particularly well-suited
            for situations where you have a large knowledge base, and you want to explore
            how facts and rules can lead to new insights, conclusions, or solutions.
            This approach is often used when the system is expected to answer questions,
            make recommendations, or solve problems by applying available knowledge.</p>
