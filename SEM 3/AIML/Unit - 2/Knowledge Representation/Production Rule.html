       <h1>Production Rule</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Production rules, key in computer science, artificial intelligence, and
          expert systems, are conditional statements used in rule-based systems for
          decision-making and inference. They consist of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Condition (Antecedent)</strong>: Specifies criteria that trigger
            the rule, often as logical statements.</li>
          <li><strong>Action (Consequent)</strong>: Details actions taken when the antecedent
            conditions are met.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Applications include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Expert Systems</strong>: Capture expert knowledge and decision
            logic.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Rules</strong>: Automate decision-making in business
            systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Control behavior and guide decision-making.</li>
          <li><strong>Databases</strong>: Trigger actions or maintain data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Example: If a customer is over 18 and an item is in stock, then allow
          the purchase.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Production rules are vital for structured knowledge representation and
          adaptable decision-making systems across various domains.</p>
