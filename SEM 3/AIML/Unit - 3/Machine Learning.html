      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Machine learning, a subfield of AI, involves creating algorithms that
          enable computers to learn and make decisions or predictions based on data,
          without explicit programming. It focuses on statistical models and algorithms
          for computers to learn and improve from experience. The goal is to analyze
          complex data patterns and use this knowledge for accurate predictions or
          actions. It includes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: Trains models on labeled data, teaching
            them to map inputs to correct outputs, used in classification and regression.</li>
          <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: Works with unlabeled data to find
            patterns or structures without predefined labels, used in clustering and
            dimensionality reduction.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Involves an agent learning to
            interact with an environment to maximize rewards, used in robotics and
            game playing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Applications of machine learning span image/speech recognition, natural
          language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous
          vehicles. It's popular due to its ability to handle large-scale data, automate
          tasks, recognize patterns, offer personalized recommendations, continuously
          learn, and support decision-making, thereby enhancing efficiency and productivity
          in various industries.</p>
