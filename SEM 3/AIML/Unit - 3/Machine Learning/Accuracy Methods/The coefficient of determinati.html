       <h1>The coefficient of determination (R - Squared) </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The coefficient of determination, R-squared (RÂ²), is a statistical measure
          for evaluating a regression model's fit. It indicates the variance proportion
          in the dependent variable explained by the model's independent variables,
          ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 means no explained variability, and 1
          signifies perfect explanation.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">R-squared assesses how well the model fits observed data, showing the
          proportion of response variable's variability due to the independent variables.
          However, a high R-squared alone doesn't guarantee model accuracy or causal
          relationships between variables. It's essential to also consider the significance
          of coefficients, model assumptions, and problem context.</p>
