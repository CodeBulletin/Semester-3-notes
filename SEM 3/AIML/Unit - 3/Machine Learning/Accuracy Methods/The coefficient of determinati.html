       <h1>The coefficient of determination (R - Squared) </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The coefficient of determination, often denoted as R-squared (RÂ²), is
          a statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a regression
          model. It quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable
          that can be explained by the independent variables in the model.</p>
        <p>R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An R-squared value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any
            of the variability in the dependent variable.</li>
          <li>An R-squared value of 1 indicates that the model perfectly explains all
            the variability in the dependent variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In simple terms, R-squared measures how well the regression model fits
          the observed data points. It provides an indication of the proportion of
          the response variable's variability that can be attributed to the independent
          variables included in the model.</p>
        <p>However, it is important to note that R-squared alone does not determine
          the validity or usefulness of a regression model. A high R-squared value
          does not necessarily imply that the model is accurate or that the independent
          variables are causally related to the dependent variable. It is crucial
          to consider other factors, such as the significance of the coefficients,
          the model assumptions, and the context of the problem, when evaluating
          the overall quality of a regression model.</p>
