       <h1>Correlation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship
          between two variables. It indicates the extent to which changes in one
          variable are associated with changes in another variable. Correlation can
          help identify the strength and direction of the relationship between variables,
          but it does not imply causation.</p>
        <p>The most common measure of correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient,
          also known as Pearson's r. It ranges from -1 to +1, where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation,
            meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases
            in a linear fashion.</li>
          <li>A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation,
            meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases in
            a linear fashion.</li>
          <li>A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship between
            the variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The formula for calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient is:</p>
        <p>r =&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{\sum(X_i - \bar X)(Y_i-\bar Y)}{\sqrt{\sum(X_i - \bar X)^2}*\sqrt{\sum(Y_i - \bar Y)^2}}\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Xᵢ and Yᵢ represent the individual data points of the two variables.</li>
          <li>X̄ and Ȳ represent the means of the two variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Correlation can also be visualized using a scatter plot, where each data
          point represents a pair of values from the two variables. The scatter plot
          can help identify the pattern and strength of the relationship between
          the variables.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that correlation measures only the linear relationship
          between variables and does not capture other types of relationships, such
          as non-linear or curvilinear relationships. Additionally, correlation does
          not imply causation, as there may be other factors or variables influencing
          the observed relationship.</p>
