       <h1>Bias and Variance</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Bias and variance are two important concepts in machine learning that
          help us understand the behavior and performance of a model.</p>
        <p><strong>Bias</strong>: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating
          a real-world problem with a simplified model. It represents the difference
          between the average prediction of the model and the true value we are trying
          to predict. A model with high bias tends to oversimplify the problem and
          make strong assumptions, leading to underfitting. In other words, the model
          is not able to capture the underlying patterns in the data.</p>
        <p><strong>Variance</strong>: Variance, on the other hand, refers to the
          variability or inconsistency of the model's predictions for different training
          sets. It measures how much the predictions of the model vary when trained
          on different subsets of the data. A model with high variance is sensitive
          to the specific training data and tends to overfit, meaning it captures
          noise and random fluctuations in the data rather than the true underlying
          patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Bias-Variance Tradeoff</strong>: The bias-variance tradeoff is
          a fundamental concept in machine learning. It states that as we decrease
          the bias of a model (by increasing its complexity), we tend to increase
          its variance, and vice versa. Finding the right balance between bias and
          variance is crucial for building a model that generalizes well to new,
          unseen data.</p>
        <p>Ideally, we want to minimize both bias and variance to achieve the best
          model performance. This can be done through techniques such as regularization,
          cross-validation, and ensemble methods. Regularization helps control the
          complexity of the model and reduce variance, while cross-validation helps
          in assessing the model's performance on unseen data. Ensemble methods,
          such as bagging or boosting, combine multiple models to reduce variance
          and improve overall performance.</p>
        <p>Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff can guide us in selecting the
          appropriate model complexity, optimizing hyperparameters, and making informed
          decisions to improve the performance of our machine learning models.</p>
