       <h1>Bias and Variance</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Bias and variance are key concepts in machine learning, relating to model
          errors and performance.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bias</strong>: Represents error due to simplifying assumptions
          in the model, leading to underfitting. A high-bias model overlooks the
          underlying patterns in data, making it too simplistic.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Variance</strong>: Indicates how much a model's predictions change
          with different training data sets, with high variance leading to overfitting.
          Such models are overly sensitive to training data, capturing noise instead
          of the true patterns.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bias-Variance Tradeoff</strong>: Essential in machine learning,
          this tradeoff suggests that reducing bias (increasing complexity) typically
          increases variance, and vice versa. The goal is to balance them for optimal
          generalization to new data.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Minimizing both bias and variance can involve regularization (to control
          complexity), cross-validation (for performance assessment), and ensemble
          methods (like bagging or boosting) to improve overall performance. Understanding
          this tradeoff helps in model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and
          enhancing model accuracy.</p>
