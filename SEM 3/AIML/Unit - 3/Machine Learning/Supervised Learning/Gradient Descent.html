       <h1>Gradient Descent</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine
          learning to minimize the cost or loss function of a model. It is an iterative
          algorithm that adjusts the parameters of a model in the direction of steepest
          descent of the cost function.</p>
        <p>The main idea behind gradient descent is to find the optimal values for
          the parameters of a model by iteratively updating them based on the gradients
          of the cost function with respect to those parameters. The gradient represents
          the direction of the steepest increase of the cost function, so by moving
          in the opposite direction (i.e., descending the gradient), we can gradually
          minimize the cost function.</p>
        <p>The algorithm starts with an initial set of parameter values and calculates
          the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. Then,
          it updates the parameters by taking a step in the opposite direction of
          the gradient, multiplied by a learning rate, which determines the size
          of the step taken in each iteration.</p>
        <p>The learning rate is an important hyperparameter that needs to be carefully
          chosen. If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm may converge slowly.
          On the other hand, if the learning rate is too large, the algorithm may
          overshoot the minimum of the cost function and fail to converge.</p>
        <p>The process of calculating the gradients and updating the parameters is
          repeated iteratively until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching
          a maximum number of iterations or achieving a desired level of convergence.</p>
        <p>Gradient descent is widely used in various machine learning algorithms,
          including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and
          deep learning. It is a fundamental optimization technique that allows models
          to learn from data and find the optimal set of parameters that minimize
          the cost function.</p>
