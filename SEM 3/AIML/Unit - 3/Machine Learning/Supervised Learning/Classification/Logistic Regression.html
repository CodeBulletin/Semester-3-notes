       <h1>Logistic Regression</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification
          tasks in machine learning. Despite its name, logistic regression is primarily
          a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm.</p>
        <p>In logistic regression, the goal is to predict the probability of an instance
          belonging to a particular class. It is a supervised learning algorithm
          that learns from labeled training data, where each instance is associated
          with a binary class label (e.g., 0 or 1).</p>
        <p>The logistic regression model uses a logistic function (also known as
          the sigmoid function) to map the input features to a probability value
          between 0 and 1. The logistic function transforms the linear combination
          of the input features and their corresponding weights into a probability
          value.</p>
        <p>During training, the model adjusts the weights of the input features to
          minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual
          class labels in the training data. This process is typically done using
          optimization algorithms like gradient descent.</p>
        <p>Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new,
          unseen data by calculating the probability of an instance belonging to
          a particular class. A threshold can be set to convert the probabilities
          into binary class predictions.</p>
        <p>Logistic regression is a popular and widely used algorithm due to its
          simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in many classification
          tasks. It is especially useful when the relationship between the input
          features and the class label is nonlinear.</p>
