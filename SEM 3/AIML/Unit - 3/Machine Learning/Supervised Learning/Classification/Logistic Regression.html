       <h1>Logistic Regression</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification
          in machine learning, functioning as a classification, not a regression
          algorithm. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a specific
          class, learning from labeled binary data (0 or 1).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The model employs a logistic (sigmoid) function to convert input feature
          combinations into a probability between 0 and 1. Training involves adjusting
          feature weights to minimize prediction errors, often using gradient descent
          optimization.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Once trained, it predicts class probabilities for new data, with a threshold
          determining binary class predictions. Logistic regression is favored for
          its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in nonlinear classification
          tasks.</p>
