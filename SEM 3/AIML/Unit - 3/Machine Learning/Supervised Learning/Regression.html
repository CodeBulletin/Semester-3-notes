       <h1>Regression</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>
          <br>Regression is a statistical modeling technique used in supervised machine
          learning to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features.
          It is commonly used when the target variable is quantitative or continuous,
          such as predicting house prices, stock market prices, or sales figures.</p>
        <p>In regression, the goal is to find the relationship between the input
          features (also known as independent variables or predictors) and the continuous
          target variable (also known as the dependent variable). The model learns
          from labeled training data, where both the input features and their corresponding
          target values are known.</p>
        <p>The regression model aims to fit a mathematical function or equation that
          best represents the relationship between the input features and the target
          variable. The model estimates the coefficients or weights associated with
          each input feature to minimize the difference between the predicted values
          and the actual target values in the training data.</p>
        <p>There are different types of regression techniques, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: Linear regression assumes a linear
            relationship between the input features and the target variable. It fits
            a straight line to the data and estimates the coefficients that define
            the line.</li>
          <li><strong>Polynomial Regression</strong>: Polynomial regression extends
            linear regression by allowing for higher-order polynomial functions to
            fit the data. It can capture more complex relationships between the input
            features and the target variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression</strong>: These are regularization
            techniques used to prevent overfitting in regression models. They introduce
            a penalty term to the loss function, which helps in reducing the impact
            of irrelevant or noisy features.</li>
          <li><strong>Support Vector Regression</strong>: Support vector regression
            is a regression technique that uses support vector machines (SVMs) to find
            the best hyperplane that fits the data. It can handle both linear and non-linear
            relationships between the input features and the target variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Tree Regression</strong>: Decision tree regression builds
            a tree-like model that splits the data based on different features and
            their thresholds. It predicts the target variable by averaging the target
            values of the training instances falling into each leaf node.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The performance of a regression model is typically evaluated using metrics
          such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared
          (coefficient of determination), which measure the accuracy and goodness
          of fit of the model.</p>
        <p>Regression is widely used in various domains, including finance, economics,
          healthcare, and social sciences, to make predictions and understand the
          relationships between variables.</p>
