      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Regression is a supervised machine learning technique for predicting continuous
          numerical values based on input features. It's applied when the target
          is quantitative, like in forecasting house prices or sales figures. The
          process involves learning the relationship between input features (independent
          variables) and a continuous target variable (dependent variable) from labeled
          training data.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key types of regression include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: Assumes a linear relationship between
            inputs and target, fitting a straight line to data.</li>
          <li><strong>Polynomial Regression</strong>: Uses higher-order polynomials
            for more complex relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Ridge and Lasso Regression</strong>: Regularization methods to
            prevent overfitting, reducing the impact of irrelevant features.</li>
          <li><strong>Support Vector Regression</strong>: Applies support vector machines
            for linear and non-linear relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Tree Regression</strong>: Builds a tree-like model, predicting
            targets based on training data in each leaf node.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Performance is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or
          R-squared. Regression is essential in finance, healthcare, and other fields
          for making predictions and understanding variable relationships.</p>
