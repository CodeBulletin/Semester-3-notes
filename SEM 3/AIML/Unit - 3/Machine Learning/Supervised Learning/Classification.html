       <h1>Classification</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Classification in machine learning is a supervised learning task that
          involves categorizing or classifying data into predefined classes or categories
          based on their features or attributes. The goal is to build a model that
          can learn from labeled training data and then predict the class or category
          of unseen or future instances.</p>
        <p>In classification, the input data is typically represented as a set of
          features or variables, and each instance is associated with a class label.
          The model learns patterns and relationships from the training data and
          uses them to make predictions on new, unseen data.</p>
        <p>There are various algorithms used for classification, such as decision
          trees, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes,
          and neural networks. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses,
          and the choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the problem and the
          characteristics of the data.</p>
        <p>Classification is widely used in various domains, including image recognition,
          spam filtering, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis,
          among others. It is an essential technique in machine learning and plays
          a crucial role in many real-world applications.</p>
