      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Classification in machine learning is a supervised task where data is
          categorized into predefined classes based on features. It involves building
          a model that learns from labeled training data to predict classes for new
          instances. The data consists of feature sets with associated class labels,
          and the model identifies patterns to make predictions.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key algorithms include decision trees, logistic regression, support vector
          machines (SVM), naive Bayes, and neural networks, chosen based on the problem
          and data characteristics.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Common applications include image recognition, spam filtering, sentiment
          analysis, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. Classification is vital
          in various real-world machine learning applications.</p>
