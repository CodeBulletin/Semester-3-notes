       <h1>Multiple Regression</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Multiple regression is a statistical modeling technique used to analyze
          the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent
          variables. It extends the concept of simple regression, where only one
          independent variable is considered, to include multiple predictors.</p>
        <p>The formula for multiple regression can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₚXₚ + ε</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Y represents the dependent variable (the variable being predicted or explained).</li>
          <li>X₁, X₂, ..., Xₚ represent the independent variables (the predictors or
            explanatory variables).</li>
          <li>β₀ represents the y-intercept, which is the value of Y when all independent
            variables are equal to zero.</li>
          <li>β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ represent the coefficients or weights associated with
            each independent variable, indicating the change in Y for a unit change
            in each respective independent variable.</li>
          <li>ε represents the error term, which accounts for the variability or noise
            in the relationship that is not explained by the model.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In multiple regression, the goal is to estimate the values of β₀, β₁,
          β₂, ..., βₚ that best fit the data and minimize the sum of squared errors
          between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.</p>
        <p>The multiple regression model allows for the analysis of the combined
          effect of multiple independent variables on the dependent variable. It
          helps to understand the individual contributions and the overall significance
          of each independent variable in explaining the variation in the dependent
          variable.</p>
