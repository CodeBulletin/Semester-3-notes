        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Continuous Variables</strong>: Can take any value within a range,
          including decimals, and measured continuously. Examples include age, height,
          and income.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Target Variables</strong>: In supervised learning, these are variables
          predicted based on input features. In regression, they're continuous values;
          in classification, categorical labels.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Dependent Variables</strong>: Influenced by other variables, they're
          predicted or explained in regression analysis, also known as response or
          outcome variables.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Outcome Variables</strong>: Represent the results or outcomes
          in a study or analysis, particularly in predictive modeling or regression.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Feature Variables</strong>: Input variables in machine learning,
          providing information about data points. Can be continuous or categorical,
          also known as independent or predictor variables.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Independent Variables</strong>: Used to explain or predict dependent
            variables, manipulated or observed in experiments to see their effect on
            the outcome.</p>
