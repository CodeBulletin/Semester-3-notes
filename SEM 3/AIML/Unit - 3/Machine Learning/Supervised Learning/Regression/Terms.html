        <p><strong>Continuous variables</strong>: Continuous variables are variables
          that can take on any value within a certain range or interval. They can
          have decimal places and can be measured on a continuous scale. Examples
          of continuous variables include age, height, weight, temperature, and income.</p>
        <p><strong>Target Variables</strong>: In the context of supervised learning,
          the target variable is the variable that we want to predict or estimate
          based on the input features. It is also known as the dependent variable
          or the outcome variable. The target variable is typically a continuous
          numerical value in regression tasks or a categorical class label in classification
          tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Dependent Variables</strong>: Dependent variables are variables
          that are influenced or affected by other variables. In the context of regression
          analysis, the dependent variable is the variable being predicted or explained
          by the independent variables. It is also referred to as the response variable
          or the outcome variable.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome Variables</strong>: Outcome variables are the variables
          of interest in a study or analysis. They represent the results or outcomes
          that are being measured or observed. In the context of regression or predictive
          modeling, the outcome variable is the variable we want to predict or estimate.</p>
        <p><strong>Feature Variables</strong>: Feature variables, also known as independent
          variables or predictor variables, are the input variables used in a machine
          learning model to make predictions or classifications. They are the variables
          that provide information or characteristics about the data points or instances.
          Feature variables can be continuous or categorical.</p>
        <p><strong>Independent Variables</strong>: Independent variables, also known
          as predictor variables or explanatory variables, are variables that are
          used to explain or predict the values of the dependent or outcome variable.
          They are the variables that are manipulated or controlled in an experiment
          or analysis to observe their effect on the dependent variable.</p>
        <p><strong>M (Example)</strong>: Let's consider an example of predicting
          house prices. In this case, the continuous variable "price" would be the
          target variable or dependent variable. The feature variables or independent
          variables could include factors such as the size of the house, the number
          of bedrooms, the location, and the age of the house. The goal would be
          to build a regression model that can predict the price of a house based
          on these features.</p>
