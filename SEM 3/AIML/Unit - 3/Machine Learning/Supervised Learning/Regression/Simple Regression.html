       <h1>Simple Regression</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Simple regression, also known as simple linear regression, is a type of
          regression analysis that models the relationship between a single independent
          variable (X) and a single dependent variable (Y). It assumes a linear relationship
          between the variables, meaning that the relationship can be represented
          by a straight line.</p>
        <p>The formula for simple regression can be expressed as:</p>
        <p><span class="math-tex">\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \varepsilon\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(Y\)</span>&nbsp;represents the dependent variable
            (the variable being predicted or explained).</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(X\)</span>&nbsp;represents the independent variable
            (the variable used to predict or explain the dependent variable).</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\beta_0\)</span>&nbsp;represents the y-intercept,
            which is the value of Y when X is equal to 0.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\beta_1\)</span>&nbsp;represents the slope of
            the line, which indicates the change in Y for a unit change in X.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\varepsilon\)</span>&nbsp;represents the error
            term, which accounts for the variability or noise in the relationship that
            is not explained by the model.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal of simple regression is to estimate the values of&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(\beta_0\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\beta_1\)</span>&nbsp;that
            best fit the data and minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted
            values and the actual values of the dependent variable.</p>
        <p>Once the regression model is fitted, it can be used to make predictions
          for new values of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(X\)</span>&nbsp;by plugging
          them into the equation and calculating the corresponding predicted values
          of Y.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that simple regression assumes certain assumptions,
          such as linearity, independence of errors, and constant variance of errors.
          These assumptions should be checked and validated before interpreting the
          results of a simple regression analysis.</p>
