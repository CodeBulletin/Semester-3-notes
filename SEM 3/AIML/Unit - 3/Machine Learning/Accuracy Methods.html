       <h1>Accuracy Methods</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Accuracy methods refer to evaluation metrics or techniques used to measure
          the performance of a classification model. Accuracy is a commonly used
          metric that quantifies the proportion of correctly classified instances
          out of the total number of instances.</p>
        <p>Here are a few accuracy methods commonly used in machine learning:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Accuracy Score</strong>: It is a straightforward method that calculates
            the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.
            It is suitable for balanced datasets but may not be reliable when dealing
            with imbalanced datasets.</li>
          <li><strong>Confusion Matrix</strong>: A confusion matrix provides a more
            detailed analysis of the model's performance by showing the counts of true
            positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
            From the confusion matrix, various metrics like precision, recall, and
            F1-score can be derived.</li>
          <li><strong>Precision and Recall</strong>: Precision measures the proportion
            of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted
            as positive. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures
            the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual
            positive instances.</li>
          <li><strong>F1-Score</strong>: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision
            and recall. It provides a balanced measure of a model's performance by
            considering both precision and recall. It is particularly useful when dealing
            with imbalanced datasets.</li>
          <li><strong>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve</strong>: The ROC
            curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between the true positive
            rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various
            classification thresholds. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is often
            used as a performance metric, with a higher value indicating better performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Validation</strong>: Cross-validation is a technique used
            to assess the model's performance by splitting the dataset into multiple
            subsets, training the model on a subset, and evaluating it on the remaining
            subset. It helps to estimate the model's performance on unseen data and
            mitigate issues like overfitting.</li>
