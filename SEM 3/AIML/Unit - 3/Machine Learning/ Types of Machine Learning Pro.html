       <h1> Types of Machine Learning Problems</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p><strong>Regression</strong>: Regression is a type of supervised learning
          where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. It involves
          training a model on labeled data with input features and corresponding
          output values. The model learns to find the relationship between the input
          variables and the continuous target variable, allowing it to make predictions
          on new, unseen data.</p>
        <p><strong>Classification</strong>: Classification is another type of supervised
          learning where the goal is to predict a categorical or discrete class label.
          The model is trained on labeled data, where each data point is assigned
          a specific class. The model learns to classify new instances into one of
          the predefined classes based on the patterns and features it has learned
          during training.</p>
        <p><strong>Clustering</strong>: Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique
          used to group similar data points together based on their inherent similarities.
          The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data without
          any predefined labels. Clustering algorithms aim to maximize the similarity
          within clusters while minimizing the similarity between different clusters.</p>
        <p><strong>Time-Series Forecasting</strong>: Time-series forecasting involves
          predicting future values based on historical data that is ordered in time.
          It is commonly used in financial forecasting, weather prediction, stock
          market analysis, and other domains where data is collected over time. Time-series
          models analyze patterns and trends in the data to make predictions about
          future values.</p>
        <p><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>: Anomaly detection is the process of
          identifying unusual or abnormal data points or patterns that deviate significantly
          from the expected behavior. It is used to detect fraudulent transactions,
          network intrusions, equipment failures, or any other unusual events. Anomaly
          detection algorithms learn the normal patterns from the data and flag instances
          that deviate from those patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Ranking</strong>: Ranking algorithms are used to order or rank
          a set of items based on their relevance or importance. This is commonly
          seen in search engines, recommendation systems, and online advertising.
          Ranking models learn from user behavior and feedback to determine the most
          relevant items for a given query or user preference.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Recommendation systems suggest items
          or content to users based on their preferences, behavior, or similarities
          to other users. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are
          common techniques used in recommendation systems. These models learn from
          historical user data to provide personalized recommendations, such as movies,
          products, or articles.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Generation</strong>: Data generation involves creating synthetic
          or artificial data that resembles real data. This can be useful when there
          is a scarcity of labeled data or when generating new data for testing and
          validation purposes. Generative models, such as generative adversarial
          networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs), are commonly used for
          data generation.</p>
        <p><strong>Optimization</strong>: Optimization algorithms aim to find the
          best solution or set of parameters that optimize a given objective function.
          This is often used in machine learning to fine-tune models, adjust hyperparameters,
          or optimize the performance of a system. Optimization techniques, such
          as gradient descent or genetic algorithms, iteratively search for the optimal
          solution in a given search space.</p>
