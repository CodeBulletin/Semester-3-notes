       <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where algorithms learn
          from labeled data to predict or classify new data. It involves training
          a model on input features and corresponding output labels. The model learns
          to generalize from these examples to predict outputs for unseen data, understanding
          the patterns between inputs and outputs.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are two main types:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Regression</strong>: Predicts continuous values, mapping inputs
            to a continuous target, like estimating house prices.</li>
          <li><strong>Classification</strong>: Predicts discrete class labels, classifying
            inputs into predefined categories, like identifying spam emails.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The training adjusts model parameters to reduce prediction errors, often
          using optimization techniques like gradient descent. After training, the
          model predicts on new data, with its performance evaluated through metrics
          like accuracy or mean squared error.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Supervised learning is vital in applications like image recognition, sentiment
          analysis, and medical diagnosis, where labeled data guides prediction.</p>
