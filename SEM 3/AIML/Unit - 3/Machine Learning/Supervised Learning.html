       <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm
          learns from labeled training data to make predictions or classify new,
          unseen data. In supervised learning, the training data consists of input
          features (also known as independent variables) and their corresponding
          output labels (also known as dependent variables or target variables).</p>
        <p>The goal of supervised learning is to train a model that can generalize
          from the provided examples and accurately predict the output labels for
          new, unseen data points. The model learns the underlying patterns and relationships
          between the input features and the output labels during the training phase.</p>
        <p>Supervised learning can be further categorized into two main types:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Regression</strong>: In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous
            numerical value. The model learns to map the input features to a continuous
            target variable. For example, predicting the price of a house based on
            its features like size, number of rooms, and location.</li>
          <li><strong>Classification</strong>: In classification, the goal is to predict
            a categorical or discrete class label. The model learns to classify the
            input features into predefined classes or categories. For example, classifying
            emails as spam or not spam based on their content and metadata.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>During the training process, the supervised learning algorithm adjusts
          the model's parameters or weights to minimize the difference between the
          predicted output and the actual output labels in the training data. This
          process is often done using optimization techniques like gradient descent.</p>
        <p>Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new,
          unseen data by applying the learned patterns and relationships. The performance
          of a supervised learning model is typically evaluated using metrics such
          as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the
          specific task and problem domain.</p>
        <p>Supervised learning is widely used in various applications, including
          image and speech recognition, sentiment analysis, credit scoring, medical
          diagnosis, and many others where labeled data is available for training
          and making predictions.</p>
