       <h1>Overfitting and underfitting</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Overfitting and underfitting are issues in machine learning related to
          a model's generalization to new data.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Overfitting</strong>: Happens when a model learns training data
          too closely, including noise, leading to great performance on training
          data but poor generalization to new data. It's marked by high training
          accuracy but low test accuracy, indicating the model is too tailored to
          training data.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Underfitting</strong>: Occurs when a model is too simple to capture
          data patterns, performing poorly on both training and new data. This is
          indicated by low accuracy on both training and test data, suggesting the
          model is overly generalized.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To combat overfitting, use regularization (adding a penalty to the objective
          function), cross-validation (splitting data to assess performance), or
          early stopping (halting training when validation performance drops).</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">For underfitting, increase model complexity, add features, or try more
          advanced algorithms, aiming for a balance between complexity and simplicity
          for optimal generalization.</p>
