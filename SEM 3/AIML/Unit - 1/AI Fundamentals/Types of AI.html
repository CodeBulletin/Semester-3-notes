       <h1>Types of AI</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Based on the capability and functionality, there are two types of AI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Type-I&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Type-II</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Type 1 AI:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Narrow AI (ANI):</strong> Specialized AI for specific tasks, like
            virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa) and recommendation systems (Netflix).</li>
          <li><strong>General AI (AGI):</strong> Hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence
            across various domains. AGI is not yet a reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> Advanced, theoretical
            AI surpassing human intelligence in every aspect. Currently speculative.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Type 2 AI:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reactive Machines:</strong> AI that operates on predefined rules
            for specific tasks, like chess programs. These systems don't learn or adapt.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Memory AI:</strong> AI capable of learning from past data
            to a limited extent, used in applications like self-driving cars.</li>
          <li><strong>Theory of Mind AI:</strong> Hypothetical AI that could understand
            human emotions and intentions. Still under development and not fully realized.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-aware AI:</strong> Conceptual AI with self-awareness and consciousness.
            Currently speculative and a subject of debate.</li>
        </ol>
