       <h1>Types of AI</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Based on the capability and functionality, there are two types of AI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Type-I&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Type-II</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Type 1</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Narrow or Weak AI (ANI):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks
            or solve particular problems.</li>
          <li>These AI systems are highly specialized and excel in their predefined
            domains.</li>
          <li>Examples include virtual personal assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), recommendation
            systems (e.g., Netflix recommendations), and autonomous vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">General or Strong AI (AGI):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>General AI, also known as Strong AI, represents a hypothetical form of
            AI that possesses human-level intelligence.</li>
          <li>AGI systems would have the ability to understand, learn, and perform tasks
            across a wide range of domains, similar to how humans do.</li>
          <li>Achieving AGI remains a significant challenge, and it does not currently
            exist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Artificial Superintelligence is an advanced, theoretical form of AI that
            surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.</li>
          <li>ASI would possess capabilities that are vastly superior to human intelligence
            and might be capable of solving complex problems, making critical decisions,
            and innovating at an unprecedented level.</li>
          <li>ASI is purely speculative and has not been realized.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Type 2</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Reactive Machines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reactive AI systems are designed to perform specific tasks based on predefined
            rules and programming.</li>
          <li>They don't possess the ability to learn or adapt to new situations or
            information.</li>
          <li>Examples include chess-playing programs like Deep Blue, which can make
            strategic moves based on predetermined rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Limited Memory AI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Limited Memory AI systems have some capacity to learn and make decisions
            based on past experiences or data.</li>
          <li>They can adapt to changing conditions to some extent.</li>
          <li>Self-driving cars often use limited memory AI to navigate and respond
            to traffic conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Theory of Mind AI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Theory of Mind AI refers to a hypothetical AI system that could understand
            and interpret human emotions, intentions, and beliefs.</li>
          <li>Such AI would be capable of more advanced social interactions and empathetic
            responses.</li>
          <li>Development in this area is ongoing but not yet fully realized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Self-aware AI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Self-aware AI is a concept of AI systems that possess self-awareness and
            consciousness, similar to human beings.</li>
          <li>This concept is highly speculative and remains a topic of philosophical
            and ethical debate.</li>
        </ul>
