       <h1>four broad types of AI Techniques</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are four broad types of AI techniques or approaches, each with its
          own characteristics and applications:</p>
        <p><strong>Symbolic AI</strong>: Utilizes explicit rules and logic for problem-solving,
          encoding human knowledge into systems. Suited for structured data and clear-rule
          problems, like in expert systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>: A data-centric approach where
          algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions. It includes
          supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, applied in image
          recognition, NLP, and predictive analytics.</p>
        <p><strong>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</strong>: Models simulating
          the human brain, with interconnected nodes. Deep Learning uses large, layered
          networks for complex tasks like image/speech recognition and autonomous
          driving. Examples include CNNs and RNNs.</p>
        <p><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms</strong>: Inspired by natural selection,
          these algorithms evolve solutions over generations, useful in optimization
          and design automation. Techniques include genetic algorithms and particle
          swarm optimization</p>
