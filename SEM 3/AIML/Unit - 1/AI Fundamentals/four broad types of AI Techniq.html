       <h1>four broad types of AI Techniques</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are four broad types of AI techniques or approaches, each with its
          own characteristics and applications:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Symbolic or Rule-Based AI:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Symbolic AI is based on the manipulation of symbols and rules. It involves
            encoding human knowledge and expertise into a system through explicit rules
            and representations.</li>
          <li>This approach is rule-driven and relies on logic and reasoning to solve
            problems.</li>
          <li>Expert systems, which use a knowledge base of rules to make decisions,
            are a classic example of symbolic AI.</li>
          <li>Symbolic AI is suited for well-defined problems with clear rules and structured
            data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Machine Learning is a data-driven approach that focuses on training algorithms
            to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data.</li>
          <li>ML models can learn from historical data and improve their performance
            over time through training.</li>
          <li>Common ML techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
            and reinforcement learning.</li>
          <li>ML is widely used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language
            processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Neural Networks and Deep Learning:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Neural networks are a subset of ML that attempts to simulate the structure
            and function of the human brain through interconnected nodes (neurons).</li>
          <li>Deep Learning, a type of neural network, involves large networks with
            many layers (deep neural networks).</li>
          <li>These techniques excel at tasks like image and speech recognition, language
            translation, and autonomous driving.</li>
          <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
            are common architectures in deep learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection
            and evolution.</li>
          <li>They involve creating a population of potential solutions and evolving
            them over generations to find the best solution to a problem.</li>
          <li>Genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and particle swarm optimization
            are examples of evolutionary techniques.</li>
          <li>These approaches are used for optimization problems, design automation,
            and genetic programming for evolving computer programs.</li>
        </ul>
