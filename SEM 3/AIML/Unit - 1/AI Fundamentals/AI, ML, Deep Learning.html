      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> AI is a broad field of computer science that
            aims to create machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically
            require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving,
            natural language understanding, perception, and decision-making.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, including
            rule-based systems, expert systems, genetic algorithms, and more. It can
            be both rule-based and learning-based.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, game-playing
            AI like AlphaGo, autonomous vehicles, and recommendation systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development
            of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their
            performance on a specific task through learning from data, without being
            explicitly programmed.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> ML is concerned with the development of algorithms
            and models that can make predictions or decisions based on data. It includes
            various techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
            reinforcement learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Spam email detection, image recognition, recommendation
            systems, and predictive analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li><strong>Definition:</strong> DL is a subset of ML that deals with artificial
            neural networks, particularly deep neural networks with multiple layers
            (deep networks). These networks are inspired by the structure and function
            of the human brain.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> DL is primarily concerned with neural networks
            that have multiple hidden layers (deep architectures). It excels at tasks
            like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and pattern
            recognition.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Image classification with Convolutional Neural
            Networks (CNNs), language translation with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
            and speech recognition with deep learning models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> These algorithms learn from labeled
            training data to make predictions or classify new data. Common algorithms
            include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and
            Neural Networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Unsupervised learning algorithms
            are used for clustering and dimensionality reduction tasks. Examples include
            K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Hierarchical
            Clustering.</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-Supervised Learning:</strong> These algorithms combine elements
            of both supervised and unsupervised learning and are often used when only
            a portion of the data is labeled.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> In reinforcement learning, algorithms
            learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving
            feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Examples include Q-learning
            and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Deep Learning Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> CNNs are primarily
            used for image and video analysis tasks due to their ability to automatically
            learn hierarchical features from data.</li>
          <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> RNNs are designed for
            sequential data and are often used in tasks involving time series analysis,
            natural language processing, and speech recognition.</li>
          <li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:</strong> LSTMs are a type
            of RNN that can capture long-range dependencies in sequential data and
            are widely used in language modeling and machine translation.</li>
          <li><strong>Transformer Models:</strong> Transformers, such as the GPT and
            BERT models, have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, including
            language understanding and generation.</li>
