       <h1>Symbolic AI</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Symbolic AI, also known as symbolic artificial intelligence or rule-based
          AI, is an approach to artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of
          symbols, rules, and logic to represent and manipulate knowledge and solve
          problems. In symbolic AI systems, knowledge is typically encoded using
          symbols and formal logic, allowing the system to reason, infer, and make
          decisions based on these symbolic representations.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of Symbolic AI include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Symbolic Representation:</strong> In symbolic AI, information and
            knowledge are represented using symbols, which can be words, numbers, or
            other abstract representations. These symbols are manipulated to perform
            tasks.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Rule-Based Reasoning:</strong> Symbolic AI systems use explicit
            rules and logic to perform reasoning and decision-making. These rules define
            how the symbols are manipulated to draw conclusions or make inferences.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> Symbolic AI systems often have a knowledge
            base that contains a repository of facts, rules, and relationships. This
            knowledge base is used to answer questions and solve problems.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Inference Engine:</strong> An inference engine is a component of
              symbolic AI systems that processes the rules and symbols to make logical
              deductions and reach conclusions.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Declarative Knowledge:</strong> Knowledge in symbolic AI is typically
                declarative, meaning it describes facts and relationships without necessarily
                specifying how to use that knowledge. The system figures out how to apply
                the knowledge through its rules and reasoning processes.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Transparency:</strong> Symbolic AI systems are often transparent
                and explainable, meaning it is possible to trace how a conclusion was reached
                by examining the rules and symbols used in the process.</li>
        </ol>
