       <h1>Symbolic AI</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Symbolic AI, or rule-based AI, employs symbols, rules, and logic to represent
          knowledge and solve problems. Key features include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Symbolic Representation:</strong> Information is encoded using
            symbols (words, numbers, etc.) for task execution.</li>
          <li><strong>Rule-Based Reasoning:</strong> Uses explicit rules and logic for
            decision-making and drawing conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> Contains facts, rules, and relationships
            to answer questions and solve problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Inference Engine:</strong> Processes rules and symbols for logical
            deductions and conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Declarative Knowledge:</strong> Describes facts and relationships,
            allowing the system to apply knowledge through rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The decision-making process is traceable
            and explainable via rules and symbols used.</li>
        </ol>
