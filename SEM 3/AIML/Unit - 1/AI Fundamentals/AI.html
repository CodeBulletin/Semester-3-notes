      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence
          in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks that
          typically require human intelligence. These machines are designed to mimic
          various aspects of human cognitive functions, such as problem-solving,
          reasoning, learning from experience, understanding natural language, and
          perceiving their environment through sensors.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques, including
          machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer
          vision, robotics, and expert systems. It has applications in various fields,
          such as healthcare, finance, automotive, education, and more, with the
          goal of improving efficiency, automation, and decision-making processes.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">AI systems can be categorized into two main types:</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Narrow or Weak AI</strong>: Narrow AI systems are designed for
              specific tasks or domains. They excel in performing predefined tasks but
              lack general intelligence. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri,
              recommendation systems on streaming platforms, and image recognition software.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>General or Strong AI</strong>: General AI refers to a hypothetical
              AI system that possesses human-level intelligence, including the ability
              to understand and perform tasks across a wide range of domains, learn from
              experiences, and exhibit common-sense reasoning. General AI does not yet
              exist and remains a subject of research and speculation.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize various industries
            and impact society in significant ways, but it also raises ethical, societal,
            and safety concerns that need to be carefully addressed as the technology
            continues to advance.</p>
