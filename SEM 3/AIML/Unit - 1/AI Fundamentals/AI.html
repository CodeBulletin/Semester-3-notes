        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the creation of machines that simulate
          human intelligence, capable of tasks like problem-solving, learning, and
          environment perception. It includes technologies like machine learning,
          natural language processing, and robotics, with applications in healthcare,
          finance, education, and more, aiming to enhance efficiency and decision-making.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">AI systems are of two types:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Narrow AI</strong>: These systems are task-specific, excelling
              in predefined activities but lacking general intelligence. Examples include
              virtual assistants and image recognition software.</li>
            <li><strong>General AI</strong>: A theoretical concept of AI with human-level
              intelligence, capable of diverse tasks and learning from experiences. This
              type of AI is not yet realized.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">AI's potential for industry revolution is significant, but it also presents
            ethical and safety challenges that need attention as the technology evolves.</p>
