       <h1>A0*</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A0* (pronounced "A-zero-star") is a variant of the A* (A-star) algorithm
          designed to handle cases where the heuristic function (h-cost) is not admissible,
          meaning it may overestimate the true cost to reach the goal. In A* search,
          an admissible heuristic guarantees that the algorithm will find the optimal
          solution. However, in some scenarios, finding an admissible heuristic can
          be challenging or impossible. A0* relaxes the admissibility requirement
          to accommodate such situations.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how the A0* algorithm works:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Initialization:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with an initial node, often called the "start" node, and a goal
            node.</li>
          <li>Create an open set and a closed set. Initially, the open set contains
            only the start node, and the closed set is empty.</li>
          <li>Assign a cost of 0 to the start node and an estimated cost (heuristic)
            from the start node to the goal node.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Main Loop:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>While the open set is not empty:
            <ul>
              <li>Select the node from the open set with the lowest total cost, which is
                the sum of the cost to reach the node from the start node (g-cost) and
                the estimated cost from that node to the goal (h-cost).</li>
              <li>Remove the selected node from the open set and add it to the closed set.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Expand Neighbors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each neighbor of the current node that is not in the closed set:
            <ul>
              <li>Calculate the cost to reach that neighbor from the start node (g-cost).</li>
              <li>Calculate the estimated cost from that neighbor to the goal (h-cost).</li>
              <li>Calculate the total cost (f-cost) as the sum of g-cost and h-cost.</li>
              <li>If the neighbor is not in the open set or if the new f-cost is lower than
                the previous f-cost for that neighbor, update the neighbor's g-cost, h-cost,
                and f-cost values.</li>
              <li>Add the neighbor to the open set if it's not already there.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Termination:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When the goal node is added to the closed set or the open set becomes
            empty (indicating that no path to the goal is possible), the algorithm
            terminates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Path Reconstruction:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a path to the goal node is found (i.e., the goal node is in the closed
            set), the algorithm can backtrack from the goal node to the start node
            using the parent pointers stored in each node to reconstruct a path.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The key difference between A* and A0* lies in the treatment of the heuristic
          function. While A* requires an admissible heuristic (one that underestimates
          or is equal to the true cost), A0* can handle heuristics that are not admissible
          (i.e., overestimating the true cost). As a result, A0* may not always find
          the optimal solution, but it can still be useful in scenarios where finding
          an admissible heuristic is difficult or impossible. However, when using
          A0*, it's essential to be aware that the solution it finds may not be optimal.</p>
