       <h1>Best First Search</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Best First Search (BFS) is a search algorithm used in artificial intelligence
          and computer science to explore states in a search space in a way that
          prioritizes the most promising states according to a specific evaluation
          function or heuristic. Unlike traditional search algorithms like breadth-first
          search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which explore states in a fixed
          order, BFS selects states based on their estimated "bestness" with respect
          to reaching a goal state.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here are the key components and characteristics of Best First Search:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Evaluation Function or Heuristic:</strong> BFS relies on an evaluation
            function or heuristic that assigns a numerical value to each state in the
            search space. This value represents the estimated cost or distance from
            the current state to the goal state. The evaluation function guides the
            search algorithm by indicating which states are the most promising based
            on this heuristic information.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Priority Queue:</strong> Best First Search maintains a priority
            queue (often implemented using a data structure like a heap) to keep track
            of the states in the search space. States are dequeued from this priority
            queue in order of their heuristic values, with the most promising states
            dequeued first.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Search Strategy:</strong> BFS explores the search space in a manner
            that prioritizes states with lower heuristic values, assuming that these
            states are more likely to lead to the goal. This makes BFS especially useful
            in problems where an estimate of the distance or cost to the goal is available.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Completeness and Optimality:</strong> The completeness and optimality
            of BFS depend on the heuristic used. If the heuristic is admissible (never
            overestimates the true cost to reach the goal) and consistent (satisfies
            the triangle inequality), then Best First Search is both complete (guaranteed
            to find a solution if one exists) and optimal (finds the shortest path
            to the goal).</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> One challenge with BFS is that it can consume
              a significant amount of memory, especially if the search space is large.
              The priority queue can become quite large, and the algorithm may require
              substantial memory resources.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Applications:</strong> Best First Search is commonly used in various
              AI applications, including pathfinding, puzzle solving, game playing (e.g.,
              chess and navigation in video games), and informed search algorithms like
              A* search, which is a variant of BFS that combines it with a cost function
              and is widely used in practical problem-solving.</li>
