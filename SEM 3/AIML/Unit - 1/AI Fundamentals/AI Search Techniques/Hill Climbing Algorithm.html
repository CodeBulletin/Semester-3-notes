       <h1>Hill Climbing Algorithm</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Hill climbing is a local search optimization algorithm in AI and machine
          learning, aiming to find the best solution iteratively. It has the following
          steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Start with an initial solution, often
            random or based on heuristics.</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assess the solution's quality using a cost
            function or other metrics.</li>
          <li><strong>Neighborhood Generation:</strong> Create neighboring solutions
            by making minor changes to the current solution.</li>
          <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Choose the best neighboring solution and update
            the current solution if better.</li>
          <li><strong>Termination Condition:</strong> Repeat until a set condition is
            met, like a maximum number of iterations or quality threshold.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">While simple and intuitive, hill climbing can get stuck in local optima
          and may not find the best global solution. Variations like simulated annealing,
          genetic algorithms, and random restart hill climbing address its limitations
          like local optima, plateaus, initialization sensitivity, premature convergence,
          lack of memory, stochasticity, infeasible solutions, and limited exploration.
          These enhancements allow for broader solution space exploration and better
          global optimum chances.</p>
