       <h1>BFS</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">BFS stands for Breadth-First Search. It is a graph traversal algorithm
          used to explore or search through a graph in a breadthward motion, visiting
          all the nodes at the same level before moving to the next level.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how the BFS algorithm works:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Start at a given source node in the graph.</li>
            <li>Enqueue the source node into a queue (usually called the "frontier").</li>
            <li>Mark the source node as visited.</li>
            <li>Repeat the following steps until the queue is empty: a. Dequeue a node
              from the queue. b. Visit the dequeued node and process it. c. Enqueue all
              its unvisited neighbors into the queue and mark them as visited.</li>
            <li>If there are still unvisited nodes in the graph, select an unvisited node
              as the new source and repeat steps 2 to 4.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">BFS explores the graph in a layer-by-layer manner, visiting all nodes
            at a particular level before moving to the next level. This ensures that
            all nodes at a shorter distance from the source are visited before nodes
            at a greater distance.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">BFS can be used to solve various graph-related problems, such as finding
            the shortest path between two nodes, determining the connected components
            of a graph, or checking if a graph is bipartite.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The key data structure used in BFS is the queue, which follows the First-In-First-Out
            (FIFO) principle. The queue is used to store the nodes that need to be
            visited, and it ensures that nodes at a higher distance from the source
            are explored after nodes at a lower distance.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">BFS guarantees that it visits all nodes reachable from the source node
            and that it visits them in the shortest possible order. It provides an
            algorithmic basis for solving various graph problems efficiently.</p>
