       <h1>A*</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The A* (pronounced "A-star") algorithm is a widely used and popular pathfinding
          algorithm in computer science and artificial intelligence. It is designed
          to find the shortest path between two points in a graph, taking into account
          the cost of moving from one node to another. A* is commonly used in applications
          such as video games, robotics, and route planning.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's an overview of how the A* algorithm works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Initialization</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Start with an initial node, often called the "start" node, and a goal
                node.</li>
              <li>Create an open set and a closed set. Initially, the open set contains
                only the start node, and the closed set is empty.</li>
              <li>Assign a cost of 0 to the start node and an estimated cost (heuristic)
                from the start node to the goal node.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Main Loop</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>While the open set is not empty:
                <ul>
                  <li>Select the node from the open set with the lowest total cost, which is
                    the sum of the cost to reach the node from the start node (g-cost) and
                    an estimated cost from that node to the goal (h-cost).</li>
                  <li>Remove the selected node from the open set and add it to the closed set.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Expand Neighbors</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>For each neighbor of the current node that is not in the closed set:
                <ul>
                  <li>Calculate the cost to reach that neighbor from the start node (g-cost).</li>
                  <li>Calculate the estimated cost from that neighbor to the goal (h-cost).</li>
                  <li>Calculate the total cost (f-cost) as the sum of g-cost and h-cost.</li>
                  <li>If the neighbor is not in the open set or if the new f-cost is lower than
                    the previous f-cost for that neighbor, update the neighbor's g-cost, h-cost,
                    and f-cost values.</li>
                  <li>Add the neighbor to the open set if it's not already there.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Termination</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>When the goal node is added to the closed set or the open set becomes
                empty (indicating that no path to the goal is possible), the algorithm
                terminates.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Path Reconstruction</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>If a path to the goal node is found (i.e., the goal node is in the closed
                set), the algorithm can backtrack from the goal node to the start node
                using the parent pointers stored in each node to reconstruct the shortest
                path.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">One of the key features of the A* algorithm is its use of heuristics (h-cost)
          to guide the search. A good heuristic can significantly improve the algorithm's
          efficiency by helping it prioritize nodes that are more likely to lead
          to the shortest path.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A* is both complete (it will find a solution if one exists) and optimal
          (it will find the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible, meaning
          it never overestimates the true cost). However, the efficiency and effectiveness
          of A* depend on the choice of heuristic and the data structure used for
          the open set (e.g., a priority queue).</p>
