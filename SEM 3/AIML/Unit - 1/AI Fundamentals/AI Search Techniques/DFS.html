        <p style="margin-left:0px;">DFS stands for Depth-First Search. It is a graph traversal algorithm that
          explores vertices or nodes of a graph by visiting the deepest vertices
          first and backtracking when necessary.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">DFS follows the principle of visiting a node and recursively exploring
          all the unvisited neighbors of that node before backtracking. It traverses
          the graph in a depthward motion until it reaches a vertex that has no unvisited
          neighbors. It then backtracks to the previous vertex and explores the next
          unvisited neighbor.</p>
