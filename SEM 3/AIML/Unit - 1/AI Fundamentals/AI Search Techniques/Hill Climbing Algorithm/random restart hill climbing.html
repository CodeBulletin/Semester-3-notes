      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Random Restart Hill Climbing is a modified hill climbing algorithm that
          addresses its limitation of getting stuck in local maxima by introducing
          random restarts.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key Points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic Hill Climbing</strong>: An iterative algorithm starting
            with a random solution, making incremental improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Maxima Problem</strong>: Tendency to get stuck at local
            maxima, points higher than immediate neighbors but not the highest overall.</li>
          <li><strong>Random Restarts Solution</strong>: Runs the hill climbing algorithm
            multiple times from different random start points to avoid local maxima.</li>
          <li><strong>Process</strong>: Starts randomly, follows hill climbing steps,
            and restarts from a new random point when a peak is reached. Repeats until
            a satisfactory solution is found or a set number of times.</li>
          <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Better chance of finding global maxima, simple
            to implement.</li>
          <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Computationally expensive, no guarantee
            of finding the global maximum.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Random Restart Hill Climbing is effective in landscapes with many local
          maxima, providing a balance of exploration and exploitation.</p>
