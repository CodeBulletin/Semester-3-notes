        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Means-End Analysis (MEA) is a problem-solving approach in cognitive
          psychology and AI, involving these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Define Current State:</strong> Identify the present situation and
            obstacles to achieving the goal.</li>
          <li><strong>Define Desired State:</strong> Specify the goal or outcome you
            aim to achieve.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify Differences:</strong> Analyze what needs to change to
            reach the goal.</li>
          <li><strong>Generate Subgoals:</strong> Break the problem into smaller, achievable
            steps that reduce differences between current and desired states.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan and Execute:</strong> Develop and implement a plan to achieve
            each subgoal.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor Progress:</strong> Continuously assess and adjust the plan
            based on progress and challenges.</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue this process until the desired state
            is achieved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">MEA helps in decomposing complex problems into manageable parts, guiding
          towards solutions through incremental steps. It's applied in fields like
          AI, psychology, and engineering for complex problem-solving and decision-making.</p>
