        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Means-End Analysis (MEA) is a problem-solving strategy used in cognitive
          psychology and artificial intelligence. It is a systematic approach to
          achieve a goal by identifying the differences between the current state
          and the desired state and then generating subgoals to bridge these differences
          incrementally. The MEA algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Define the Current State</strong>: Identify the current situation
            or state of affairs, along with any obstacles or barriers preventing the
            achievement of the goal.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Define the Desired State</strong>: Clearly specify the goal or
            desired outcome you want to achieve.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Identify Differences</strong>: Analyze the differences between
            the current state and the desired state. What needs to change or be achieved
            to reach the goal?</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Generate Subgoals</strong>: Break down the problem into smaller,
            more manageable subgoals. These subgoals should be steps that, when completed,
            reduce the differences between the current state and the desired state.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Plan and Execute</strong>: Create a plan or sequence of actions
            to achieve each subgoal. Execute these actions in a systematic manner,
            working towards each subgoal one at a time.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Monitor Progress</strong>: Continuously assess your progress towards
              the subgoals and the overall goal. Adjust your plan as necessary if unexpected
              obstacles or challenges arise.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Repeat</strong>: Continue generating subgoals, planning, and executing
              until you have successfully reached the desired state and achieved the
              ultimate goal.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">MEA is often used in problem-solving tasks where the solution is not immediately
          obvious and requires a series of intermediate steps. It helps individuals
          or AI systems decompose complex problems into more manageable parts and
          guides them toward a solution through step-by-step progress.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">MEA has been used in various fields, including artificial intelligence,
          cognitive psychology, and engineering, to develop algorithms and strategies
          for solving complex problems, planning, and decision-making. It is a fundamental
          concept in understanding how humans approach and solve problems.</p>
