       <h1>Problem characterization and reduction</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Problem Characterization:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem characterization</strong> involves gaining a deep understanding
            of a complex problem by examining its various aspects, constraints, and
            requirements. This step is crucial before attempting to solve the problem.</li>
          <li>Key aspects of problem characterization include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Defining the problem</strong>: Clearly articulating the problem
                statement and its objectives.</li>
              <li><strong>Identifying constraints</strong>: Recognizing any limitations,
                restrictions, or conditions that must be adhered to during problem-solving.</li>
              <li><strong>Gathering data</strong>: Collecting relevant information and data
                that can inform the problem-solving process.</li>
              <li><strong>Understanding stakeholders</strong>: Identifying the individuals
                or entities affected by or interested in the problem and their perspectives.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Problem characterization helps in framing the problem correctly, which
            is essential for selecting the most appropriate problem-solving approach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Problem Reduction:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem reduction</strong> is a strategy used to simplify complex
            problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems
            or components. Each subproblem is easier to solve than the original problem.</li>
          <li>The process of problem reduction involves:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Decomposition</strong>: Dividing the problem into smaller, interconnected
                parts or subproblems.</li>
              <li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Focusing on the essential elements of each
                subproblem while temporarily ignoring irrelevant details.</li>
              <li><strong>Solving subproblems</strong>: Addressing each subproblem individually,
                often using specialized techniques or algorithms.</li>
              <li><strong>Integration</strong>: Combining the solutions to the subproblems
                to arrive at a solution for the original, larger problem.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Problem reduction can make complex problems more tractable, as it allows
            for the application of specific problem-solving methods to each subproblem,
            potentially leading to more efficient solutions.</li>
        </ul>
