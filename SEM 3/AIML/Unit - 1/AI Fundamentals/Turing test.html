       <h1>Turing test</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit human-like
          intelligence. In this test, a human evaluator engages in a conversation
          with a machine and a human without knowing which is which. If the evaluator
          cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human based on their responses,
          the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test and demonstrated a level
          of artificial intelligence that is indistinguishable from human intelligence
          in conversation.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of the Turing Test is to assess a machine's ability to exhibit
          human-like intelligence and conversational behavior. Specifically, it aims
          to determine whether a machine can engage in natural language conversation
          to a degree where it becomes indistinguishable from a human participant.
          In other words, if a human evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between
          a machine and a human in a text-based conversation, the machine is considered
          to have passed the Turing Test. This test serves as a benchmark for evaluating
          the conversational and linguistic capabilities of artificial intelligence
          systems and is used to measure progress in the field of AI and natural
          language processing.</p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>It focuses primarily on language-based conversation and not taking into
            account other important aspects such as problem-solving, perception, decision-making
            etc.</li>
          <li>The results of the test can be influenced by the biases, making it difficult
            to obtain objectives and reliable results.</li>
          <li>May not be suitable to test for intelligence as different computing systems
            are structured differently.</li>
