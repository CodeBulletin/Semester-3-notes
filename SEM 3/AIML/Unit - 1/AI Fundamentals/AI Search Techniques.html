          <br>AI search techniques are methods used in artificial intelligence to explore
          and navigate through problem spaces in order to find solutions, reach goals,
          or make informed decisions. These techniques are particularly valuable
          for solving problems where the solution is not immediately apparent and
          requires a systematic exploration of possibilities. There are several types
          of AI search techniques, including:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Uninformed Search Techniques (Blind Search):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These techniques explore the problem space without using any additional
            information or heuristics. They are primarily based on the structure of
            the problem.</li>
          <li>Common uninformed search algorithms include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> Explores all neighbor nodes
                at the current depth before moving on to the next depth level.</li>
              <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> Follows a single branch as deeply
                as possible before backtracking.</li>
              <li><strong>Uniform Cost Search (UCS):</strong> Expands the node with the lowest
                path cost.</li>
              <li><strong>Bidirectional Search:</strong> Simultaneously explores the problem
                space from both the start and goal states, meeting in the middle.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Informed Search Techniques (Heuristic Search):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Informed search techniques use heuristics or domain-specific knowledge
            to guide the search process, making it more efficient by focusing on promising
            areas of the problem space.</li>
          <li>Common informed search algorithms include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>A* Search:</strong>Uses a combination of the cost to reach a node
                and a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal to prioritize node
                expansion.</li>
              <li><strong>Greedy Best-First Search:</strong> Expands nodes that appear to
                be closest to the goal based on a heuristic estimate.</li>
              <li><strong>IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*):</strong> A variant of A* that uses
                iterative deepening to find solutions while maintaining the optimality
                of the search.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
