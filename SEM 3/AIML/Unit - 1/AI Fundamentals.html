       <h1>AI Fundamentals</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a subfield of artificial intelligence
            (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models
            that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through
            learning from data.</li>
          <li>Instead of being explicitly programmed for a task, ML systems are trained
            using large datasets, allowing them to recognize patterns, make predictions,
            and adapt to new information.</li>
          <li>ML techniques include supervised learning (learning from labeled data),
            unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement
            learning (learning through interaction with an environment).</li>
          <li>ML is used in various applications, such as image and speech recognition,
            recommendation systems, predictive analytics, and autonomous decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> is a branch of AI that focuses
            on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines
            to understand, interpret, and generate human language.</li>
          <li>NLP encompasses tasks like text analysis, sentiment analysis, language
            translation, speech recognition, and chatbots.</li>
          <li>NLP technologies use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to
            process and understand human language, making it possible for computers
            to interact with humans in a more natural and human-like way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Machine Vision/Computer Vision:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Machine Vision</strong> or <strong>Computer Vision</strong> is a
            field of AI that aims to enable computers to interpret and understand the
            visual world, much like humans do with their eyes and brain.</li>
          <li>It involves the development of algorithms and models to analyze and make
            sense of images or videos.</li>
          <li>Applications of computer vision include object detection, facial recognition,
            medical image analysis, autonomous vehicles (where cameras perceive the
            environment), and quality control in manufacturing.</li>
          <li>Computer vision often uses deep learning techniques like Convolutional
            Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features and recognize objects in images.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Automation and Robotics:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automation</strong> involves the use of technology and machines
            to perform tasks or processes with minimal human intervention. Automation
            can be applied in various industries, such as manufacturing, logistics,
            and finance, to improve efficiency and reduce errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Robotics</strong> is a field that deals with the design, construction,
            operation, and use of robots. Robots are autonomous or semi-autonomous
            machines that can perform tasks in the physical world.</li>
          <li>Automation and robotics often work together to create automated systems
            with robotic components. For example, industrial robots are used in manufacturing
            to automate tasks like welding, assembly, and packaging.</li>
          <li>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in collaborative robots
            (cobots) that work alongside humans, often using AI and machine learning
            for tasks that require adaptability and learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms:</strong> These algorithms are inspired
          by the process of natural selection and are used for optimization tasks,
          such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Expert Systems:</strong> Rule-based systems that rely on human
          knowledge and expertise to make decisions or provide recommendations in
          specific domains.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Fuzzy Logic:</strong> Fuzzy logic allows for degrees of truth,
          which is especially useful in situations where information is imprecise
          or uncertain.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Probabilistic Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms that use probability
          theory to make decisions and predictions, often used in Bayesian networks
          and probabilistic graphical models.</p>
