        <h2>(a) Analyze the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with respect to the seven problem characteristics.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization
          problem in the field of computer science and mathematics. In its classic
          form, the problem can be described as follows:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Given a list of cities and the distances
          between each pair of cities, the TSP asks for the shortest possible route
          that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Is the problem decomposable into the smaller problem - <strong>No</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reason</strong>: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is not
                easily decomposable into smaller subproblems because it is an NP-hard problem.
                This means that there is no known efficient algorithm to break it down
                into smaller, independent subproblems that can be solved separately and
                then easily combined to find the optimal solution for the entire problem</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>can solution steps be ignored or undone - <strong>No</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reason</strong>: in the context of the Traveling Salesperson Problem
                (TSP), once you have taken a solution step (e.g., visiting a city), it
                cannot be easily ignored or undone. TSP is a problem where you must find
                the most efficient route that visits all cities exactly once and returns
                to the starting city. Each step in the solution builds upon the previous
                steps, and there is no straightforward way to backtrack or undo a step
                without reconsidering the entire solution. To improve or change the solution,
                you typically need to explore different permutations or heuristics from
                scratch.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>is the universe of the problem predictable - <strong>No</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reason</strong>: the universe of the Traveling Salesperson Problem
                (TSP) is not predictable in the sense that there is no known efficient
                algorithm to predict or determine the optimal solution for a large number
                of cities in polynomial time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>is a good solution to the problem absolute or relative - <strong>Relative</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reason</strong>: A good solution to the Traveling Salesperson
                Problem (TSP) is relative rather than absolute. In TSP, the goal is to
                find a tour that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting
                city while minimizing the total distance or cost of the tour. However,
                what is considered a "good" solution can vary depending on the specific
                instance of the problem, the available computational resources, and the
                specific requirements or constraints of the problem.
                <br>There may be instances of TSP where it is impossible to find the absolute
                optimal solution due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, and in
                such cases, a good solution is relative to the algorithms and heuristics
                used to solve it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>is the problem to the solution state or a path - <strong>path</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reason</strong>: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a
                problem related to finding the optimal path or tour that visits all cities
                exactly once and returns to the starting city while minimizing the total
                distance or cost of the tour.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Is their need of knowledge in solving this problem using ai - <strong>Yes</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Problem Representation:</strong> You need knowledge to represent
                the TSP problem correctly.</li>
              <li><strong>Algorithm Selection:</strong> Choosing the right AI algorithm or
                technique for solving TSP requires knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses
                of different approaches.&nbsp;</li>
              <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Parameter Tuning:</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Result Evaluation</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Algorithm Adaptation</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Does the task of solving this problem requires human intervention - <strong>No</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reason</strong>: TSP is a mathematical and computational problem,
                and there are various algorithms and techniques that can be applied to
                solve it without direct human involvement</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <h2>(b) Define state spaces in AI. Why are they useful? Write state space for any suitable problem of your choice.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In artificial intelligence, a state space represents the set of all possible
          states that a problem-solving agent can encounter while trying to reach
          a goal or solve a particular problem. It is a fundamental concept in various
          AI techniques, especially in search algorithms and problem-solving domains.
          The state space defines the environment or problem in terms of its possible
          configurations, and agents navigate through this space to find a solution
          or make decisions.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">State spaces are useful in AI for several reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Problem Representation</strong>: State spaces provide a structured
            and organized way to represent complex problems, making them easier to
            analyze and solve.</li>
          <li><strong>Search and Planning</strong>: State spaces are crucial for search
            algorithms like breadth-first search, depth-first search, A* search, and
            more. Agents can systematically explore the state space to find a solution.</li>
          <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong>: By defining the state space, AI systems
            can break down a problem into manageable states and transitions, allowing
            for step-by-step problem solving.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision-Making</strong>: State spaces help in modeling decision-making
            processes in AI, enabling agents to make informed choices by evaluating
            the consequences of different actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Heuristic Evaluation</strong>: In many AI applications, state
            spaces are used in conjunction with heuristics to estimate the distance
            or cost to the goal state. This guides the search process efficiently.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Now, let's define a simple state space for the "8-Puzzle" problem as an
          example:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Problem:</strong> The 8-Puzzle is a classic puzzle game consisting
          of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one blank space. The objective
          is to rearrange the tiles to reach a target configuration, usually starting
          from a scrambled initial state.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>State Space Representation:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each state in the state space represents a unique arrangement of the 8
            puzzle tiles (numbers 1 through 8) and one empty space.</li>
          <li>The state space can be represented as a 3x3 grid, where each cell can
            contain either a tile (numbered 1-8) or be empty (represented as blank).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's an example of an initial state and a target (goal) state:</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Initial State:</strong>
          </p>
          <figure class="table">
            <table>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>&nbsp;</td>
                  <td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>8</td>
                  <td>7</td>
                  <td>6</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </figure>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Goal State:</strong>
          </p>
          <figure class="table">
            <table>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>&nbsp;</td>
                  <td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>6</td>
                  <td>7</td>
                  <td>8</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </figure>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">In this example, the state space consists of all possible configurations
            of the 8-Puzzle that can be reached through legal tile moves (up, down,
            left, or right). Agents can use various search algorithms to navigate this
            state space to find a sequence of moves that transform the initial state
            into the goal state.</p>
