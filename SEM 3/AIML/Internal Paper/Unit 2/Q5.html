        <h2>(a) Explain the following term providing an example<br>1. Modus Ponen<br>2. Modus Tollen</h2>
        <p><strong>Modus Ponens</strong> (also known as "affirming the antecedent"):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.</li>
          <li>Example: If it rains, the ground will be wet. It is raining. Therefore,
            the ground is wet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Modus Tollens</strong> (also known as "denying the consequent"):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure: If P, then Q. Q is not true. Therefore, P is not true.</li>
          <li>Example: If it is a cat, it has four legs. My pet does not have four legs.
            Therefore, my pet is not a cat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In both cases, the structure of the argument is crucial to its validity.
          Modus Ponens affirms the first statement to reach a conclusion, while Modus
          Tollens negates the second statement to reach a different conclusion. Both
          are widely used in mathematical and philosophical reasoning.</p>
        <h2>(b) Summarize approaches to Knowledge Representation (KR).</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Knowledge representation is a crucial component of artificial intelligence
          and cognitive science. It involves the encoding of information in a form
          that can be used to reason, make decisions, and solve problems. Two common
          approaches to knowledge representation are Propositional Logic and First-Order
          Predicate Logic.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Propositional Logic</strong></span>: Propositional
          logic, also known as propositional calculus, is a simple form of logic
          that deals with propositions or statements. In this approach, knowledge
          is represented using atomic propositions and logical operators to connect
          them. Here are the key components of propositional logic:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Atomic Propositions:</strong> These are basic statements that are
            either true or false. They represent facts or conditions in the world.</li>
          <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> Propositional logic uses operators
            such as AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), IMPLIES (→), and IF AND ONLY IF (↔) to
            combine and manipulate propositions.</li>
          <li><strong>Truth Tables:</strong> Truth tables are used to represent the truth
            values of compound propositions based on the truth values of their constituent
            atomic propositions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>First-Order Predicate Logic</strong></span>:
          First-order predicate logic, also known as first-order logic or FOL, is
          a more expressive and versatile logic system for knowledge representation.
          It extends propositional logic by introducing variables, quantifiers, and
          predicates. Here are the key components of first-order predicate logic:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Constants and Variables:</strong> Constants represent specific
            objects or individuals, while variables can stand for any object within
            a specified domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Predicates:</strong> Predicates represent relationships or properties
            of objects. They take arguments (constants, variables) and can be used
            to make statements about the world.</li>
          <li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> First-order logic uses quantifiers, such
            as ∀ (universal quantifier) and ∃ (existential quantifier), to express
            statements about all or some objects within a domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Functions can be used to represent operations
            or relationships that produce new objects based on existing objects.</li>
          <li><strong>Connectives:</strong> Logical connectives like ∧ (AND), ∨ (OR),
            ¬ (NOT), → (IMPLIES), and ↔ (IF AND ONLY IF) are also used in first-order
            logic to build complex statements.</li>
        </ol>
