       <h1>Authorization Patterns </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Authorization patterns, also known as authorization models or access control
          patterns, are commonly used approaches to implementing access control in
          software systems. These patterns provide guidelines and best practices
          for managing and enforcing authorization rules to ensure that users have
          the appropriate permissions to access resources or perform specific actions.</p>
        <p>Here are some commonly used authorization patterns:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: RBAC is a widely used
            authorization pattern that assigns permissions to roles and then associates
            roles with users. Users are granted access based on their assigned roles,
            simplifying access management and reducing administrative overhead. RBAC
            is effective for managing access in large systems with complex user roles
            and permissions.</li>
          <li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong>: ABAC is an authorization
            pattern that grants access based on attributes associated with users, resources,
            and environmental conditions. It uses policies that evaluate attributes
            to determine access rights. ABAC provides fine-grained access control and
            dynamic decision-making based on contextual information, such as user attributes,
            resource properties, and environmental factors.</li>
          <li><strong>Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: RBAC is an authorization
            pattern that uses rules to determine access rights. Rules are defined based
            on conditions and actions, and access decisions are made by evaluating
            these rules. RBAC allows for flexible access control based on specific
            conditions or combinations of conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Permission-Based Access Control</strong>: Permission-based access
            control is a simple authorization pattern where access is granted based
            on explicit permissions assigned to users or user groups. Each resource
            or action is associated with a set of permissions, and users are granted
            access based on their assigned permissions. This pattern is commonly used
            in smaller systems with a limited number of users and resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>: MAC is an authorization
            pattern commonly used in high-security environments. It enforces access
            control based on predefined security labels or classifications assigned
            to users and resources. Access decisions are made based on the security
            labels and a set of predefined rules or policies. MAC provides strong access
            control but requires careful configuration and management.</li>
          <li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong>: DAC is an authorization
            pattern where access control decisions are left to the discretion of the
            resource owner. The resource owner determines who can access the resource
            and what level of access is granted. DAC provides flexibility but can lead
            to inconsistent access control if not properly managed.</li>
