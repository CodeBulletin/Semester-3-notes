       <h1>Identity management</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Identity management, also known as identity and access management (IAM),
          refers to the processes, technologies, and policies used to manage and
          control digital identities within an organization. It involves managing
          user identities, their authentication, authorization, and access to resources
          and systems.</p>
        <p>Identity management encompasses various aspects, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>User Provisioning</strong>: User provisioning involves creating,
            modifying, and disabling user accounts and their associated access rights.
            It ensures that users have the appropriate access privileges based on their
            roles and responsibilities within the organization.</li>
          <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Authentication is the process of verifying
            the identity of users accessing a system or application. It typically involves
            the use of usernames and passwords, but can also include additional factors
            such as biometrics, smart cards, or one-time passwords for stronger security.</li>
          <li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Authorization determines what resources
            and actions a user is allowed to access or perform within a system or application.
            It is based on the user's authenticated identity and their assigned roles,
            permissions, or attributes.</li>
          <li><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong>: SSO enables users to authenticate
            once and gain access to multiple systems or applications without the need
            to re-enter their credentials. It improves user experience and reduces
            the burden of managing multiple passwords.</li>
          <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: RBAC is a method of
            managing access rights based on predefined roles. Users are assigned specific
            roles, and their access privileges are determined by the permissions associated
            with those roles. RBAC simplifies access management by grouping users with
            similar responsibilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Identity Federation</strong>: Identity federation allows users
            to access resources across different organizations or domains using their
            existing credentials. It establishes trust relationships between identity
            providers and service providers, enabling seamless and secure access to
            shared resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Password Management</strong>: Password management involves enforcing
            strong password policies, such as password complexity requirements, expiration
            periods, and password history. It may also include self-service password
            reset mechanisms and multi-factor authentication to enhance security.</li>
          <li><strong>Audit and Compliance</strong>: Identity management systems often
            include auditing capabilities to track user activities, access requests,
            and changes to user identities and permissions. This helps organizations
            meet regulatory compliance requirements and detect any unauthorized or
            suspicious activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Identity Lifecycle Management</strong>: Identity lifecycle management
            encompasses the entire lifecycle of a user's identity within an organization,
            from onboarding to offboarding. It includes processes for user registration,
            account provisioning, access rights management, and deprovisioning when
            users leave the organization.</li>
          <li><strong>Identity Governance</strong>: Identity governance focuses on defining
            and enforcing policies and controls related to identity management. It
            ensures that access rights are granted based on business needs, compliance
            requirements, and least privilege principles.</li>
