       <h1>Basic security for HTTP Applications</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Securing HTTP applications is essential to protect them from various security
          threats. Here are some basic security measures you can implement for HTTP
          applications:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Use HTTPS</strong>: Implement HTTPS (HTTP Secure) to encrypt the
            communication between the web server and the user's browser. This ensures
            that sensitive data, such as login credentials and personal information,
            is transmitted securely. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted certificate
            authority (CA) and configure your web server to use HTTPS.</li>
          <li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Validate and sanitize all user input
            to prevent common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
            Use input validation techniques such as whitelisting, blacklisting, and
            parameterized queries to mitigate these risks. Avoid executing user input
            as code or directly incorporating it into SQL queries.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Authentication</strong>: Implement strong authentication
            mechanisms to verify the identity of users accessing the application. Use
            secure password storage techniques, such as hashing and salting, to protect
            user passwords. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)
            for an extra layer of security.</li>
          <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Implement proper access controls to restrict
            unauthorized access to sensitive resources. Ensure that users only have
            access to the resources they need. Use role-based access control (RBAC)
            or attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms to manage user permissions
            effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Implement proper error handling and avoid
            displaying detailed error messages to users. Provide generic error messages
            instead of revealing sensitive information that could be exploited by attackers.</li>
          <li><strong>Session Management</strong>: Implement secure session management
            techniques to prevent session hijacking and session fixation attacks. Use
            secure session tokens, enable session timeouts, and regenerate session
            identifiers after successful authentication or privilege changes.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Headers</strong>: Set appropriate security headers in
            the HTTP response to enhance security. For example, use the Content Security
            Policy (CSP) header to restrict the types of content that can be loaded
            on your web pages, and use the X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking
            attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Updates and Patching</strong>: Keep your web server, application
            framework, and libraries up to date with the latest security patches. Regularly
            monitor for vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly to mitigate potential
            risks.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Testing</strong>: Conduct regular security testing, including
            vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, to identify and address
            any weaknesses in your application's security. This helps in proactively
            identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.</li>
          <li><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Implement logging and monitoring
            mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents. Monitor system
            logs, network traffic, and user activities to identify any suspicious behavior
            or unauthorized access attempts.</li>
