      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Web application vulnerabilities refer to security flaws or weaknesses
          in a web application that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized
          access or cause other malicious activities. Some of the most common web
          application vulnerabilities include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>SQL Injection</strong>: This occurs when an attacker can insert
            or manipulate SQL queries in the input fields of the application, potentially
            gaining access to or manipulating the database.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>: This vulnerability allows
            attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users,
            which can lead to hijacking user sessions, defacing websites, or redirecting
            the user to malicious sites.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>: This attack forces
            an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they
            are currently authenticated.</li>
        </ol>
