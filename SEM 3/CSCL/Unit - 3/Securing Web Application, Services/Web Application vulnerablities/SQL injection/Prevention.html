        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Prevention of SQL Injection:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Use Prepared Statements</strong>: With prepared statements, the
            SQL query is defined first, and then the input is sent to the server separately,
            ensuring that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Input Validation/Sanitization</strong>: Validate or sanitize user
            inputs to ensure they do not contain malicious SQL.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Least Privilege Principle</strong>: Ensure that the database user
              used by the application has only the necessary permissions, reducing the
              potential impact of an SQL injection attack.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>ORMs (Object-Relational Mappings)</strong>: Using ORMs can abstract
              the SQL layer, reducing the risk of injection, though they are not foolproof.</li>
            <li
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Regular Security Audits</strong>: Regularly testing and auditing
              the application for vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Understanding and implementing these practices is crucial for the security
          of any application that interacts with a SQL database.</p>
