       <h1>Cross-Site Request Forgery CSRF</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of security attack on web
          applications. It tricks the user into performing unwanted actions on a
          web application where they are currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically
          target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has
          no way to see the response to the forged request.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>How CSRF Works:</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>User Authentication</strong>: The user logs into a web application,
          and the application authenticates the user.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Session Cookie</strong>: The application creates a session cookie
          that is stored in the user's browser. This cookie is used for subsequent
          requests to authenticate the user.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Malicious Request</strong>: The attacker tricks the user into
          making an unwanted request to the web application (e.g., through a deceptive
          email, link, or a form on a different website). This request is made with
          the user's credentials (like cookies) automatically included by the browser.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Execution of Request</strong>: The web application can't distinguish
          this malicious request from a legitimate request made by the user and executes
          it.</p>
