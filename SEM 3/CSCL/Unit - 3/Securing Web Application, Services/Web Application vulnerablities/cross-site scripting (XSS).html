       <h1>cross-site scripting (XSS)</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically
          found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts
          into web pages viewed by other users. This kind of vulnerability exploits
          the fact that a web application sends data received from one user to other
          users without validating or encoding it.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">XSS attacks can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Stealing Cookies or Sessions</strong>: By executing scripts in
            the context of the user's browser, attackers can access cookies, session
            tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used
            with that site.</li>
          <li><strong>Impersonating the User</strong>: Attackers can perform actions
            on behalf of the user within the web application, if they can execute scripts
            in the user's browser context.</li>
          <li><strong>Defacing Websites</strong>: Injecting scripts can change the appearance
            of a web page or display false information to users.</li>
          <li><strong>Browser-Based Exploits</strong>: Running unauthorized scripts
            in the context of the user's browser can lead to other exploits, depending
            on the nature of the script and the browser's vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are several types of XSS attacks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reflected XSS</strong>: The malicious script is part of the victim's
            request to the website, typically in a URL query string, and is reflected
            back to the user in the response.</li>
          <li><strong>Stored XSS</strong>: The malicious script is stored on the website
            itself (like in a database), and is then served to users in the normal
            course of using the site.</li>
          <li><strong>DOM-Based XSS</strong>: The vulnerability exists in the client-side
            code rather than server-side code. The attack occurs when the web application's
            client-side scripts write data provided by the user to the Document Object
            Model (DOM).</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Preventing XSS involves validating and/or encoding user inputs, and using
          secure programming practices. Modern web frameworks and libraries often
          provide features to automatically handle these security concerns.</p>
