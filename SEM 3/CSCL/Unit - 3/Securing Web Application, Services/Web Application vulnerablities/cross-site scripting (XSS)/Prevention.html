       <h1>Prevention</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prevent XSS attacks, developers should follow secure coding practices,
          such as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Validate and sanitize user input to
            ensure that it does not contain malicious scripts.</li>
          <li><strong>Output Encoding:</strong> Encode user input when displaying it
            in the HTML to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Implement a Content Security
            Policy to restrict the types of content that can be loaded and executed
            on a web page.</li>
          <li><strong>HTTPOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies:</strong> Use the HTTPOnly
            flag for cookies to prevent them from being accessed through JavaScript,
            and use the Secure flag to ensure that cookies are transmitted over secure
            (HTTPS) connections only.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">By incorporating these practices, developers can significantly reduce
          the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in their web applications. Security awareness
          and regular security audits are also crucial for identifying and addressing
          potential vulnerabilities.</p>
