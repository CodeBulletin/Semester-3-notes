       <h1>SQL injection</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of attack that takes advantage of vulnerabilities
          in the way a website processes SQL queries. It occurs when an attacker
          is able to insert or "inject" a malicious SQL query into the input fields
          of a web application, which is then executed by the database server. This
          can lead to various harmful consequences, such as data theft, data loss,
          or complete control over the database.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>How SQL Injection Works:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>User Input Handling</strong>: In a vulnerable application, user
            input (like form data) is directly used in constructing SQL queries.</li>
          <li
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Injection of Malicious SQL</strong>: An attacker provides SQL
            code as part of the input data, which gets concatenated with the SQL query
            in the application code.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Execution of Malicious Query</strong>: The database server executes
              the modified query, which may include unauthorized data access, data manipulation,
              or administrative operations.</li>
