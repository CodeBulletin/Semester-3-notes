       <h1>Email security</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Email security involves measures to protect emails from unauthorized access,
          breaches, and threats. It's essential for safeguarding sensitive information
          and privacy. Key aspects include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Ensures only intended recipients can read
            emails, with transport layer security (TLS) for server communication and
            end-to-end encryption for message content.</li>
          <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Techniques like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
            verify sender authenticity, preventing spoofing and phishing.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-Malware and Anti-Spam</strong>: Filters block malicious attachments,
            links, and spam using heuristics, blacklists, and machine learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing Protection</strong>: Includes user education, filters
            to block phishing emails, and authentication to verify senders.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</strong>: Prevents sensitive data leakage
            in emails, using scans and encryption.</li>
          <li><strong>Email Archiving and Retention</strong>: Stores emails to meet
            legal requirements and for auditing.</li>
          <li><strong>User Awareness and Training</strong>: Educates users on security
            best practices and threat recognition.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident Response and Monitoring</strong>: Involves monitoring
            and responding to security incidents, analyzing suspicious activities,
            and having a response plan.</li>
        </ol>
