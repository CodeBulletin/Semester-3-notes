      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Firewalls are essential network security devices that serve as barriers
          between internal networks and external networks, including the internet.
          They monitor, control, and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic
          based on set security rules. This involves examining network packets and
          deciding to allow or block traffic based on criteria like IP addresses,
          port numbers, protocols, and application-level information.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are various types of firewalls:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network Firewalls</strong>: Positioned between internal and external
            networks, these can be hardware or software-based, inspecting traffic at
            the packet level to enforce security policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Host-Based Firewalls</strong>: Software applications on individual
            computers or servers, focusing on traffic at the operating system or application
            level, offering targeted protection for each host.</li>
          <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)</strong>: These combine traditional
            firewall functions with advanced features like intrusion prevention, deep
            packet inspection, and user identity-based controls, providing heightened
            security against complex threats.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Firewalls' primary roles include filtering traffic to prevent unauthorized
          or malicious access, protecting against network-based attacks such as DDoS,
          monitoring and logging traffic for security analysis, and enforcing network
          security policies to comply with regulatory standards.</p>
