       <h1>Firewall</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>A firewall is a network security device that acts as a barrier between
          an internal network and external networks, such as the internet. Its primary
          function is to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic
          based on predetermined security rules.</p>
        <p>Firewalls are designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private
          network while allowing legitimate communication to pass through. They examine
          network packets and apply rules to determine whether to allow or block
          the traffic. These rules can be based on various factors, including source
          and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and specific application-level
          information.</p>
        <p>Firewalls can be implemented in different forms:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network Firewalls</strong>: Network firewalls are typically hardware
            or software-based devices that sit between an internal network and external
            networks. They inspect network traffic at the packet level and enforce
            security policies to protect the network from unauthorized access and potential
            threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Host-Based Firewalls</strong>: Host-based firewalls are software
            applications installed on individual computers or servers. They monitor
            and control network traffic at the operating system or application level,
            providing an additional layer of protection for the specific host.</li>
          <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)</strong>: NGFWs combine traditional
            firewall functionality with advanced features, such as intrusion prevention,
            deep packet inspection, application awareness, and user identity-based
            controls. They provide enhanced security capabilities and visibility into
            network traffic, allowing for more granular control and protection against
            sophisticated threats.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Firewalls play a crucial role in network security by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules to block
            malicious or unauthorized access attempts.</li>
          <li>Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources and protecting against
            network-based attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</li>
          <li>Monitoring and logging network traffic for security analysis and incident
            response purposes.</li>
          <li>Enforcing network security policies and ensuring compliance with regulatory
            requirements.</li>
        </ul>
