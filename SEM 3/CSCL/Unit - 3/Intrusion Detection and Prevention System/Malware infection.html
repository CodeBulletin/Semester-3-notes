      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Malware infection refers to the process of a computer or device being
          compromised by malicious software, commonly known as malware. Malware is
          designed to infiltrate a system without the user's consent and can cause
          various harmful effects, such as stealing sensitive information, damaging
          files, disrupting system operations, or even taking control of the infected
          device. Malware can be spread through various means, including email attachments,
          malicious websites, infected software downloads, or removable media. It
          is important to have up-to-date antivirus software and practice safe browsing
          habits to minimize the risk of malware infections.</p>
