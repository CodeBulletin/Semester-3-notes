       <h1>Intrusion detection and prevention techniques</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Intrusion detection and prevention techniques are security measures used
          to identify and mitigate unauthorized access attempts or malicious activities
          within a computer network or system. Here are some commonly used techniques:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)</strong>: NIDS
            monitors network traffic in real-time, analyzing packets and looking for
            suspicious patterns or known attack signatures. It can alert administrators
            when potential intrusions are detected.</li>
          <li><strong>Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)</strong>: HIDS operates
            on individual hosts or servers, monitoring system logs, file integrity,
            and other host-specific activities. It can detect unauthorized changes,
            suspicious processes, or abnormal behavior on a specific host.</li>
          <li><strong>Firewalls</strong>: Firewalls act as a barrier between internal
            and external networks, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic
            based on predefined security rules. They can block unauthorized access
            attempts and prevent certain types of attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)</strong>: IPS combines the
            functionalities of NIDS and firewalls. It not only detects potential intrusions
            but also actively blocks or prevents them from occurring by taking automated
            actions, such as dropping malicious packets or reconfiguring network settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</strong>: SIEM
            systems collect and analyze log data from various sources, including network
            devices, servers, and applications. They correlate events and generate
            alerts based on predefined rules, helping to identify potential security
            incidents.</li>
          <li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning</strong>: Vulnerability scanning tools
            scan networks or systems for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
            or weak points that could be exploited by attackers. Regular scanning helps
            identify and patch vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.</li>
          <li><strong>User Behavior Analytics (UBA)</strong>: UBA tools analyze user
            behavior patterns to detect anomalies that may indicate unauthorized access
            or malicious activities. They can identify unusual login times, access
            patterns, or abnormal data transfers.</li>
