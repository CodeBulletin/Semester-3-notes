       <h1>Network-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS)</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Network-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS) are security systems
          that go beyond the detection capabilities of NIDS by actively preventing
          and blocking potential intrusions or malicious activities within a computer
          network. NIPS work in real-time, monitoring network traffic and taking
          automated actions to mitigate threats. Here are some key aspects of NIPS:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Real-time Traffic Analysis</strong>: NIPS analyze network packets
            and inspect their content, headers, and behavior to identify potential
            threats or suspicious activities. They use various techniques, including
            signature-based detection, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis,
            to detect known and unknown threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Signature-based Prevention</strong>: NIPS utilize a database of
            known attack signatures to compare against network traffic. If a packet
            or a series of packets matches a known signature, the NIPS can take immediate
            action to block or drop the malicious packets, preventing the attack from
            reaching its target.</li>
          <li><strong>Anomaly-based Prevention</strong>: NIPS can also employ anomaly-based
            detection techniques to identify deviations from normal network behavior.
            If the traffic patterns or behaviors are deemed abnormal or suspicious,
            the NIPS can take proactive measures to block or mitigate the potential
            threat.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Prevention Alerts</strong>: When NIPS detects a potential
            intrusion or malicious activity, it generates alerts or notifications to
            inform administrators or security personnel. These alerts provide details
            about the detected event, allowing for prompt investigation and response.</li>
          <li><strong>Automated Response and Mitigation</strong>: Unlike NIDS, NIPS
            can actively respond to detected threats by taking automated actions to
            prevent or mitigate the impact of an attack. This can include blocking
            malicious IP addresses, dropping suspicious packets, or reconfiguring network
            settings to isolate affected systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration with Network Infrastructure</strong>: NIPS can integrate
            with network devices, such as routers or switches, to enforce security
            policies and control network traffic. This integration allows for more
            granular control and enables the NIPS to take immediate action at the network
            level.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Updates</strong>: NIPS continuously
            monitor network traffic, adapting to new threats and vulnerabilities. Regular
            updates to the NIPS system ensure that it has the latest threat intelligence
            and can effectively protect against emerging threats.</li>
