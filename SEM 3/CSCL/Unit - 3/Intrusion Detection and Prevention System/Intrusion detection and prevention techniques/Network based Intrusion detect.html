       <h1>Network based Intrusion detection Systems</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are security systems
          that monitor network traffic in real-time to detect and respond to potential
          intrusions or malicious activities. NIDS analyze network packets and look
          for patterns or signatures that indicate known attacks or suspicious behavior.
          Here are some key aspects of NIDS:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Packet Analysis</strong>: NIDS inspect network packets flowing
            through the network infrastructure. They examine packet headers and payloads
            to identify anomalies or patterns that match known attack signatures.</li>
          <li><strong>Signature-based Detection</strong>: NIDS use a database of known
            attack signatures to compare against the network traffic. If a packet or
            a series of packets matches a known signature, an alert is generated to
            notify administrators of a potential intrusion.</li>
          <li><strong>Anomaly-based Detection</strong>: In addition to signature-based
            detection, NIDS can also employ anomaly-based detection techniques. They
            establish a baseline of normal network behavior and compare it to real-time
            traffic. If there are significant deviations from the baseline, it may
            indicate an intrusion or abnormal activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Alerts</strong>: When NIDS detects suspicious
            activity, it generates alerts or notifications to inform administrators
            or security personnel. These alerts provide details about the detected
            event, such as the source and destination IP addresses, the type of attack,
            and the severity level.</li>
          <li><strong>Network Traffic Monitoring</strong>: NIDS continuously monitor
            network traffic, capturing and analyzing packets from various network segments
            or specific points within the network infrastructure. This allows for comprehensive
            visibility into network activities and helps identify potential threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Response and Mitigation</strong>: While NIDS primarily focus on
            detection, some systems can also take automated actions to respond to detected
            intrusions. For example, they can block or drop malicious packets, reconfigure
            network settings, or trigger other security mechanisms to mitigate the
            impact of an attack.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</strong>:
            NIDS can integrate with SIEM systems to provide centralized logging, analysis,
            and correlation of security events across the network. This integration
            enhances the overall security posture and enables better incident response.</li>
