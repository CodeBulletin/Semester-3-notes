       <h1>Host based Intrusion prevention Systems</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Host-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS) are security systems that
          operate on individual hosts or servers to detect and prevent unauthorized
          access attempts or malicious activities at the host level. Unlike network-based
          intrusion prevention systems (NIPS), which monitor network traffic, HIPS
          focus on protecting the specific host or server where they are installed.
          Here are some key aspects of HIPS:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Host-based Monitoring</strong>: HIPS continuously monitor the
            activities and behaviors of the host system, including system logs, file
            integrity, registry changes, process activities, and network connections.
            This allows them to detect and respond to potential intrusions or malicious
            activities that may not be visible at the network level.</li>
          <li><strong>Behavior-based Detection</strong>: HIPS use behavior-based detection
            techniques to identify abnormal or suspicious activities on the host. They
            establish a baseline of normal behavior and compare it to real-time activities.
            If there are significant deviations or patterns that indicate potential
            threats, the HIPS can take action to prevent or mitigate the impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Signature-based Detection</strong>: HIPS also utilize a database
            of known attack signatures to compare against the host's activities. If
            a process or behavior matches a known signature, the HIPS can take immediate
            action to block or terminate the suspicious activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Prevention Alerts</strong>: When HIPS detects a potential
            intrusion or malicious activity, it generates alerts or notifications to
            inform administrators or security personnel. These alerts provide details
            about the detected event, allowing for prompt investigation and response.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy Enforcement</strong>: HIPS enforce security policies at
            the host level, allowing administrators to define rules and restrictions
            for specific processes, file access, network connections, and system configurations.
            This helps prevent unauthorized activities and ensures compliance with
            security policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Response and Mitigation</strong>: HIPS can take automated actions
            to respond to detected threats. This can include blocking network connections,
            terminating malicious processes, isolating affected files or directories,
            or triggering other security mechanisms to mitigate the impact of an attack.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</strong>:
            HIPS can integrate with SIEM systems to provide centralized logging, analysis,
            and correlation of security events at the host level. This integration
            enhances the overall security posture and enables better incident response.</li>
