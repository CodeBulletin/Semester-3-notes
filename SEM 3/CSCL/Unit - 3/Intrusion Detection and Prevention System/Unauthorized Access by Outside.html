       <h1>Unauthorized Access by Outsider</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Unauthorized access by an outsider refers to the act of an individual
          or entity gaining access to a system, network, or resource without proper
          authorization or permission. This unauthorized access can pose significant
          security risks and can lead to various negative consequences, such as data
          breaches, theft of sensitive information, disruption of services, or unauthorized
          modifications to systems.</p>
        <p>Outsiders attempting unauthorized access can include hackers, cybercriminals,
          or individuals with malicious intent who are not authorized users or legitimate
          stakeholders of the system or network. They may exploit vulnerabilities
          in the system, employ hacking techniques, or use social engineering tactics
          to gain unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>Some common methods used by outsiders to gain unauthorized access include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Brute-Force Attacks</strong>: Attackers attempt to gain access
            by systematically trying different combinations of usernames and passwords
            until they find the correct credentials.</li>
          <li><strong>Exploiting Vulnerabilities</strong>: Attackers exploit security
            vulnerabilities in software, operating systems, or network infrastructure
            to gain unauthorized access. This can involve exploiting known software
            vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weak security controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing and Social Engineering</strong>: Attackers use deceptive
            techniques, such as phishing emails, fake websites, or phone calls, to
            trick users into revealing their login credentials or other sensitive information.</li>
          <li><strong>Password Guessing</strong>: Attackers attempt to guess passwords
            by using common passwords, personal information about the target, or by
            using automated tools that try different combinations of passwords.</li>
          <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</strong>: Attackers intercept and manipulate
            communication between two parties to gain unauthorized access to sensitive
            information or to impersonate one of the parties.</li>
          <li><strong>Network Sniffing</strong>: Attackers capture and analyze network
            traffic to intercept and extract sensitive information, such as usernames,
            passwords, or other confidential data.</li>
        </ol>
