       <h1>Anti-malware software</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Anti-malware software, also known as antivirus software, is a type of
          security software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software
          (malware) from a computer or device. It helps protect against various types
          of malware, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware,
          and other malicious programs.</p>
        <p>Anti-malware software works by scanning files, programs, and the overall
          system for known malware signatures or suspicious behavior. It compares
          the scanned data against a database of known malware signatures to identify
          and quarantine or remove any detected threats. Some advanced anti-malware
          software also uses heuristic analysis and machine learning algorithms to
          detect new or unknown malware based on behavioral patterns.</p>
        <p>In addition to real-time scanning, anti-malware software often includes
          features such as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>On-demand scanning</strong>: Allows users to manually initiate
            scans of specific files, folders, or the entire system.</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic updates</strong>: Regularly updates the malware database
            to stay up-to-date with the latest threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Quarantine or isolation</strong>: Moves detected malware to a
            secure area, preventing it from causing further harm while allowing users
            to review and potentially restore or delete the quarantined files.</li>
          <li><strong>Web protection</strong>: Monitors web browsing activities and
            blocks access to malicious websites or downloads.</li>
          <li><strong>Email scanning</strong>: Scans incoming and outgoing emails for
            malware attachments or suspicious links.</li>
          <li><strong>Firewall integration</strong>: Works in conjunction with a firewall
            to provide comprehensive protection against network-based attacks.</li>
        </ol>
