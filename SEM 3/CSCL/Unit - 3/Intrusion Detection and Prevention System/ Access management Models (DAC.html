       <h1> Access management Models (DAC, MAC, RBAC, ABAC)</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Access management models, also known as access control models, are frameworks
          that define how access to resources is granted, managed, and enforced within
          a system or organization. Three commonly used access management models
          are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong>: In the DAC model,
            access control decisions are at the discretion of the resource owner. The
            resource owner determines who can access the resource and what level of
            access is granted. Each resource has an associated access control list
            (ACL) that specifies the permissions granted to individual users or groups.
            DAC provides flexibility, as resource owners have control over access,
            but it can lead to inconsistent access control if not properly managed.</li>
          <li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>: In the MAC model, access
            control decisions are based on security labels and a set of predefined
            rules or policies. Access is granted or denied based on the sensitivity
            of the resource and the security clearance of the user. MAC enforces strict
            access control based on predefined security levels and is commonly used
            in environments with high-security requirements, such as government or
            military systems. MAC provides strong access control but requires careful
            configuration and management.</li>
          <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: In the RBAC model,
            access control decisions are based on roles rather than individual users.
            Users are assigned specific roles based on their job responsibilities,
            and access permissions are associated with these roles. RBAC simplifies
            access management by grouping users with similar responsibilities and granting
            access based on their assigned roles. It provides a scalable and manageable
            approach to access control, especially in large systems with complex user
            roles and permissions.</li>
          <li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong>: ABAC is a flexible
            access management model that grants access based on attributes associated
            with users, resources, and environmental conditions. It uses policies that
            evaluate attributes to determine access rights. ABAC provides fine-grained
            access control and dynamic decision-making based on contextual information,
            such as user attributes, resource properties, and environmental factors.
            It allows for more granular control and adaptability in access management.</li>
