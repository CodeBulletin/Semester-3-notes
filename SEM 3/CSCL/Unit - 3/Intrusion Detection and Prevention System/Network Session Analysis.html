       <h1>Network Session Analysis</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Network session analysis is the examination of network interactions to
          understand traffic, communication patterns, and security issues. It involves
          several key processes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Session Capture:</strong> Using tools or packet capture techniques
            to record interactions between network devices or endpoints.</li>
          <li><strong>Traffic Analysis:</strong> Evaluating captured data to understand
            traffic patterns, protocols, and device behaviors, and to identify anomalies
            or security threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Protocol Analysis:</strong> Dissecting and examining protocols
            in sessions to spot issues, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance Monitoring:</strong> Analyzing sessions for performance
            issues like bottlenecks or latency to optimize network efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Analysis:</strong> Identifying potential security threats
            or malicious activities by scrutinizing session content and behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Detection:</strong> Detecting intrusions or suspicious
            activities by comparing sessions against known attack patterns or behaviors.</li>
          <li><strong>Forensic Analysis:</strong> Utilizing captured sessions for forensic
            investigations to reconstruct events, trace attack sources, or gather legal
            evidence.</li>
        </ol>
