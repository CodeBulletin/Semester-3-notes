       <h1>Security Information Management</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Security Information Management (SIM), also known as Security Information
          and Event Management (SIEM), is a method for managing and analyzing security
          data within an IT infrastructure. It combines security event management
          (SEM) and SIM to offer a unified platform for handling security data. Key
          aspects include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Log Collection:</strong> Aggregating security logs from various
            sources to monitor system activities and potential incidents.</li>
          <li><strong>Event Correlation:</strong> Analyzing data from different sources
            to identify security patterns and complex attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> Providing instant alerts for prompt
            incident response based on predefined rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Threat Intelligence Integration:</strong> Enhancing detection by
            incorporating external information about threats and vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident Response and Workflow:</strong> Streamlining the management
            of security incidents from detection to resolution.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance and Reporting:</strong> Assisting in regulatory compliance
            with customizable reports and dashboards.</li>
          <li><strong>Forensic Analysis:</strong> Storing logs for extended periods for
            post-incident analysis and legal investigations.</li>
        </ol>
