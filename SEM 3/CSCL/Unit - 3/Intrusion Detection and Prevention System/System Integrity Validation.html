       <h1>System Integrity Validation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>System Integrity Validation refers to the process of verifying and ensuring
          the integrity and authenticity of system files, configurations, and settings.
          It involves checking the integrity of critical system components to detect
          any unauthorized modifications, tampering, or corruption. Here are some
          key aspects of System Integrity Validation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>File Integrity Checking</strong>: System Integrity Validation
            involves comparing the current state of system files against known, trusted
            reference files. This can be done by calculating and comparing cryptographic
            hashes (such as MD5 or SHA-256) of the files. If the calculated hash values
            match the reference values, it indicates that the files have not been tampered
            with. Any discrepancies or changes in the hash values may indicate unauthorized
            modifications or potential security breaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Configuration Validation</strong>: System Integrity Validation
            also includes verifying the integrity of system configurations and settings.
            This involves comparing the current configuration settings against a known
            baseline or desired state. Any deviations or unauthorized changes in the
            configuration settings can be identified and flagged as potential security
            risks.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Boot Verification</strong>: Secure Boot is a security feature
            that ensures only trusted and digitally signed software is loaded during
            the system boot process. System Integrity Validation includes verifying
            the integrity of the Secure Boot process to ensure that the system boots
            with trusted software and has not been compromised by unauthorized or malicious
            code.</li>
          <li><strong>Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Validation</strong>: TPM is a hardware-based
            security feature that provides secure storage and cryptographic functions.
            System Integrity Validation may involve validating the integrity and functionality
            of the TPM to ensure its proper operation and protection against tampering.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: System Integrity Validation is
            an ongoing process that involves continuous monitoring of system files,
            configurations, and settings. Regular checks and validations are performed
            to detect any changes or anomalies that may indicate unauthorized modifications
            or security breaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Logging and Alerting</strong>: System Integrity Validation often
            includes logging and alerting mechanisms to record and notify administrators
            of any detected discrepancies or unauthorized changes. This helps in timely
            detection and response to potential security incidents.</li>
