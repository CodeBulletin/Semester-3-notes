       <h1>System Integrity Validation</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">System Integrity Validation ensures the authenticity and integrity of
          system files, configurations, and settings, aiming to detect unauthorized
          changes or corruption. Key components include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>File Integrity Checking:</strong> Comparing system files' cryptographic
            hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) against trusted references to detect tampering.</li>
          <li><strong>Configuration Validation:</strong> Verifying system settings against
            a baseline to identify unauthorized changes or security risks.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Boot Verification:</strong> Ensuring only trusted, digitally
            signed software loads during the boot process to prevent compromise by
            malicious code.</li>
          <li><strong>TPM Validation:</strong> Checking the Trusted Platform Module for
            proper operation and protection against tampering.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Regularly monitoring system components
            for changes or anomalies that could indicate security breaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Logging and Alerting:</strong> Recording and notifying administrators
            of discrepancies or unauthorized alterations for timely response to security
            incidents.</li>
        </ol>
