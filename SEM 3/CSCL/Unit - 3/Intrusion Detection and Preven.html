       <h1>Intrusion Detection and Prevention System</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) is a security solution
          that helps detect and prevent unauthorized access, intrusions, and malicious
          activities within a network or system. It monitors network traffic, system
          logs, and user activities to identify potential security breaches and take
          appropriate actions to mitigate them.
          <br>IDPS can help address various security concerns, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intrusions</strong>: IDPS monitors network traffic and system
            logs for signs of unauthorized access attempts, such as port scanning,
            brute-force attacks, or exploitation of vulnerabilities. It can detect
            and alert administrators about potential intrusions, allowing them to take
            immediate action to prevent further compromise.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Theft</strong>: In some cases, IDPS can be integrated
            with physical security systems, such as surveillance cameras or access
            control systems. This integration allows for the detection of physical
            theft or unauthorized access to restricted areas. For example, if an unauthorized
            individual attempts to gain access to a server room, the IDPS can trigger
            an alert or initiate an automated response.</li>
          <li><strong>Abuse of Privileges</strong>: IDPS can monitor user activities
            and detect any misuse or abuse of privileges within a system. It can identify
            suspicious behavior, such as unauthorized access attempts, unauthorized
            changes to system configurations, or unauthorized data access. By detecting
            and alerting administrators about such activities, IDPS helps prevent insider
            threats and unauthorized use of privileges.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>IDPS typically operates in two modes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</strong>: IDS monitors network
            traffic and system logs, analyzing them for known patterns or signatures
            of attacks or malicious activities. When a potential threat is detected,
            IDS generates an alert to notify administrators, who can then investigate
            and respond accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</strong>: IPS goes beyond detection
            and actively takes preventive measures to block or mitigate potential threats.
            It can automatically block suspicious network traffic, terminate connections,
            or modify firewall rules to prevent further intrusion attempts.</li>
        </ol>
