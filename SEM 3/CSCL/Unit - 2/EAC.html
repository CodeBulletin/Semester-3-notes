       <h1>EAC</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Email Account Compromise (EAC) is a type of cybercrime where an individual's
          email account is illegally accessed and controlled by an unauthorized person,
          typically a cybercriminal. This can happen through various methods, such
          as phishing attacks, where the victim is tricked into providing their login
          credentials, or through the exploitation of security vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Once the attacker gains access to an email account, they can use it for
          several malicious activities, including:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Identity Theft</strong>: Impersonating the victim to commit fraud
              or other crimes.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Fraud</strong>: Accessing and misusing sensitive financial
              information like bank account details.</li>
            <li><strong>Spreading Malware</strong>: Sending malicious links or attachments
              to the victim's contacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Information Theft</strong>: Stealing personal or business-related
              confidential information.</li>
            <li><strong>Ransom Demands</strong>: Locking the victim out of their account
              and demanding a ransom for its release.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">EAC poses significant risks, especially in business settings, where access
            to an email account can lead to broader network infiltration and data breaches.
            To prevent EAC, it's essential to use strong, unique passwords, enable
            two-factor authentication, be vigilant against phishing attempts, and regularly
            update security software.</p>
