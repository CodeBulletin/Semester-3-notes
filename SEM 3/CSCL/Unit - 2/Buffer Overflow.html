       <h1>Buffer Overflow</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Buffer Overflow is a type of software vulnerability that occurs when a
          program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (a temporary storage
          area) than it can handle. This can lead to the overflow of excess data
          into adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting other data or executing
          arbitrary code.</p>
        <p>Here's how Buffer Overflow works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Buffer allocation</strong>: When a program allocates memory for
            a buffer, it sets aside a specific amount of memory to store data.</li>
          <li><strong>Insufficient bounds checking</strong>: If the program does not
            properly check the size of the data being inputted into the buffer, it
            may allow more data to be stored than the allocated memory can hold.</li>
          <li><strong>Data overflow</strong>: When more data is inputted than the buffer
            can handle, the excess data overflows into adjacent memory locations, potentially
            overwriting important data or control structures.</li>
          <li><strong>Code execution or system compromise</strong>: If the overflowed
            data contains executable code or instructions, it can be executed by the
            program, leading to arbitrary code execution. This can allow an attacker
            to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious actions, or take control
            of the affected system.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to execute
          arbitrary code, crash a program, gain unauthorized access, or escalate
          privileges. They are commonly found in programs written in low-level languages
          like C or C++, where manual memory management is required.</p>
        <p>To prevent Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities, developers can follow secure
          coding practices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Input validation and bounds checking</strong>: Validate and sanitize
            all user input to ensure it does not exceed the allocated buffer size.
            Perform proper bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.</li>
          <li><strong>Use secure coding libraries and functions</strong>: Utilize secure
            coding libraries and functions that handle memory management and input
            validation automatically, reducing the risk of buffer overflows.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable compiler security features</strong>: Enable compiler security
            features, such as stack canaries or address space layout randomization
            (ASLR), which can detect or mitigate buffer overflow attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular updates and patches</strong>: Keep the software and its
            dependencies up to date with the latest security patches to address any
            known vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ol>
