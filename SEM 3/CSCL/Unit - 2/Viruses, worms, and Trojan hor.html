       <h1>Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses are different types of malicious software,
          commonly referred to as malware, that can infect and compromise computer
          systems. Here's a brief explanation of each:</p>
        <p><strong>Virus</strong>: A computer virus is a type of malware that can
          replicate itself and spread from one computer to another by attaching itself
          to executable files or documents. Viruses typically require user interaction,
          such as opening an infected file or running a malicious program, to initiate
          their replication and spread. Once activated, viruses can cause various
          harmful effects, such as corrupting or deleting files, disrupting system
          operations, or stealing sensitive information.</p>
        <p><strong>Worm</strong>: A computer worm is a self-replicating malware that
          can spread across computer networks without requiring user interaction.
          Worms exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols or operating systems
          to automatically replicate and infect other computers. They can consume
          network bandwidth, degrade system performance, and carry out malicious
          activities, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or launching distributed
          denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
        <p><strong>Trojan horse</strong>: A Trojan horse, or simply Trojan, is a
          type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software or files to
          deceive users into executing or installing it. Unlike viruses and worms,
          Trojans do not replicate themselves. Instead, they often rely on social
          engineering techniques to trick users into downloading and running them.
          Once installed, Trojans can perform various malicious actions, such as
          stealing sensitive information, providing unauthorized access to the attacker,
          or installing additional malware.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that while viruses, worms, and Trojans are distinct
          types of malware, they can often be used in combination or work together
          to carry out more sophisticated attacks. Additionally, the terms "virus"
          and "worm" are sometimes used interchangeably, as some malware may exhibit
          characteristics of both.</p>
        <p>To protect against viruses, worms, and Trojans, it is crucial to follow
          these security practices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware software and keep it up to date.</li>
          <li>Regularly update your operating system and applications to patch security
            vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li>Be cautious when downloading files or clicking on links from unknown or
            untrusted sources.</li>
          <li>Enable automatic updates for your software and use a firewall to monitor
            and control network traffic.</li>
          <li>Exercise caution when opening email attachments or downloading files from
            the internet.</li>
          <li>Educate yourself about common social engineering techniques and be vigilant
            for signs of suspicious activity on your computer or network.</li>
        </ul>
