       <h1>Keyloggers</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Keyloggers, also known as keystroke loggers or keyboard capturers, are
          types of malicious software or hardware devices designed to record and
          monitor keystrokes on a computer or mobile device. They capture and log
          every keystroke entered by a user, including passwords, credit card numbers,
          personal messages, and other sensitive information.</p>
        <p>Keyloggers can be classified into two main categories:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Software-based keyloggers</strong>: These are malicious programs
            or malware that are installed on a victim's computer or device without
            their knowledge or consent. They can be delivered through various means,
            such as infected email attachments, malicious downloads, or compromised
            websites. Once installed, software-based keyloggers run in the background,
            capturing and recording keystrokes, and then send the collected data to
            the attacker.</li>
          <li><strong>Hardware-based keyloggers</strong>: These are physical devices
            that are physically connected between the keyboard and the computer or
            inserted into the USB port. Hardware keyloggers can be difficult to detect
            as they do not rely on software installations. They record keystrokes directly
            from the keyboard and store the data internally. Attackers can retrieve
            the recorded data by physically accessing the device.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Keyloggers can pose significant security risks and compromise the privacy
          of individuals or organizations. The captured keystrokes can be used by
          attackers to gain unauthorized access to online accounts, steal sensitive
          information, perform identity theft, or carry out other malicious activities.</p>
        <p>To protect against keyloggers, it is important to follow these security
          practices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware software and keep it up to date
            to detect and remove keyloggers.</li>
          <li>Be cautious when downloading files or clicking on links from unknown or
            untrusted sources.</li>
          <li>Regularly update your operating system and applications to patch security
            vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li>Use a virtual keyboard or secure input methods when entering sensitive
            information, especially on public or untrusted computers.</li>
          <li>Be vigilant for signs of suspicious activity, such as unexpected system
            slowdowns, unusual network traffic, or unauthorized access to accounts.</li>
          <li>Consider using two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication
            (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>
        </ol>
