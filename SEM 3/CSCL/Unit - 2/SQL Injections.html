       <h1>SQL Injections</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>SQL Injection is a type of web application vulnerability that allows an
          attacker to manipulate or inject malicious SQL (Structured Query Language)
          code into an application's database query. It occurs when user-supplied
          input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in an SQL
          statement.</p>
        <p>Here's how SQL Injection works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>User input</strong>: An application accepts user input, such as
            form fields, search queries, or URL parameters, and uses it to construct
            an SQL query.</li>
          <li><strong>Malicious input</strong>: An attacker submits specially crafted
            input that includes SQL code as part of the user input. This can be done
            by manipulating form fields, modifying URL parameters, or using other techniques.</li>
          <li><strong>Injection point</strong>: The attacker's input is not properly
            validated or sanitized by the application, allowing the malicious SQL code
            to be included in the query.</li>
          <li><strong>Execution</strong>: The application constructs the SQL query using
            the user input, including the injected SQL code. The database executes
            the query, treating the injected code as legitimate SQL commands.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact</strong>: The injected SQL code can perform various malicious
            actions, such as retrieving, modifying, or deleting data from the database,
            bypassing authentication mechanisms, or even gaining unauthorized access
            to the underlying server.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>SQL Injection can have serious consequences, including unauthorized access
          to sensitive data, data manipulation or deletion, and potential compromise
          of the entire application or system.</p>
        <p>To prevent SQL Injection attacks, it is important to follow secure coding
          practices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Input validation and sanitization</strong>: Validate and sanitize
            all user input before using it in SQL queries. Use parameterized queries
            or prepared statements with placeholders to separate the SQL code from
            the user input.</li>
          <li><strong>Least privilege principle</strong>: Ensure that database accounts
            used by the application have the minimum necessary privileges to limit
            the potential impact of an SQL Injection attack.</li>
          <li><strong>Principle of least exposure</strong>: Avoid exposing detailed
            error messages or stack traces to users, as they can provide valuable information
            to attackers.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular updates and patches</strong>: Keep the application and
            its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches to address
            any known vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ol>
