       <h1>Steganography</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Steganography is the practice of concealing or hiding information within
          other non-secret data or media, such as images, audio files, video files,
          or text. Unlike encryption, which focuses on making the content of a message
          unreadable, steganography aims to make the existence of the message undetectable.</p>
        <p>The process of steganography involves embedding the secret information,
          known as the payload, into the carrier data, known as the cover media.
          The resulting file appears unchanged to the casual observer, but the hidden
          information can be extracted or revealed by those who know the method or
          key used for embedding and extracting.</p>
        <p>There are various techniques used in steganography, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Image Steganography</strong>: This involves hiding information
            within the pixels of an image. The least significant bits (LSBs) of the
            color channels can be modified to encode the hidden data without significantly
            altering the visual appearance of the image.</li>
          <li><strong>Audio Steganography</strong>: In this technique, secret information
            is embedded within audio files by modifying certain audio properties, such
            as the amplitude or frequency. The changes are typically imperceptible
            to the human ear.</li>
          <li><strong>Video Steganography</strong>: Similar to image steganography,
            video steganography hides information within video files by modifying certain
            frames or frames' properties. The changes are often subtle and difficult
            to detect.</li>
          <li><strong>Text Steganography</strong>: This technique involves hiding information
            within the structure or formatting of a text document. For example, invisible
            characters or whitespace can be used to encode the hidden data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Steganography can be used for various purposes, including covert communication,
          digital watermarking, copyright protection, and data hiding. However, it
          can also be misused for illegal activities, such as hiding malicious code
          or sensitive information for unauthorized access.</p>
