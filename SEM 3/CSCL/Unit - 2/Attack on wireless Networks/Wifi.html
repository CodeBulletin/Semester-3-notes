        <p>Attacks on Wi-Fi networks can compromise the security and privacy of the
          network and its users. Here are some common attacks on Wi-Fi networks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Wi-Fi Eavesdropping</strong>: Attackers can intercept and capture
            wireless network traffic to eavesdrop on sensitive information, such as
            usernames, passwords, or financial data. This can be done using tools like
            packet sniffers or by setting up rogue access points to capture network
            traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</strong>: In a MitM attack, an
            attacker positions themselves between the wireless client and the access
            point, intercepting and potentially modifying the communication between
            them. This allows the attacker to capture sensitive information or inject
            malicious content into the communication.</li>
          <li><strong>Rogue Access Points</strong>: Attackers can set up unauthorized
            access points that mimic legitimate networks to trick users into connecting
            to them. Once connected, the attacker can capture sensitive information
            or launch further attacks on the connected devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks</strong>: Attackers can flood
            a Wi-Fi network with a high volume of traffic or malicious packets, causing
            the network to become overwhelmed and unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
          <li><strong>Password Cracking</strong>: Attackers can attempt to crack the
            Wi-Fi network's encryption key, such as the WEP or WPA/WPA2 passphrase,
            to gain unauthorized access to the network.</li>
          <li><strong>Evil Twin Attacks/Wi-Fi Phising: </strong>Similar to rogue access
            points, an evil twin is a malicious Wi-Fi network that masquerades as a
            legitimate one. Once connected, users' data can be monitored and stolen.</li>
          <li><strong>KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack)</strong><span style="color:rgb(209,213,219);">: This is a severe weakness in the WPA2 protocol that allows attackers to decrypt network traffic, potentially exposing sensitive information.</span>
          </li>
          <li><span style="color:rgb(209,213,219);"><strong>Packet Injection</strong>: Attackers inject malicious packets into legitimate Wi-Fi traffic, which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in connected devices or applications.</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To protect against these attacks, it is important to implement strong
          security measures for wireless networks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Use strong encryption</strong>: Implement WPA2 or WPA3 encryption
            with a strong passphrase to secure the wireless network.</li>
          <li><strong>Change default settings</strong>: Change default usernames, passwords,
            and SSIDs to unique values to prevent easy access by attackers.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable network segmentation</strong>: Separate the wireless network
            from the main network using VLANs or separate subnets to limit the potential
            impact of an attack.</li>
          <li><strong>Regularly update firmware</strong>: Keep wireless access points
            and routers up to date with the latest firmware to patch security vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Use strong authentication</strong>: Implement strong authentication
            mechanisms, such as 802.1X/EAP, to ensure that only authorized devices
            can connect to the network.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor network traffic</strong>: Regularly monitor network traffic
            for any suspicious activity or unauthorized devices connected to the network.</li>
          <li><strong>Educate users</strong>: Train users to be cautious when connecting
            to wireless networks, to avoid connecting to unknown or untrusted networks,
            and to be aware of potential phishing attempts.</li>
