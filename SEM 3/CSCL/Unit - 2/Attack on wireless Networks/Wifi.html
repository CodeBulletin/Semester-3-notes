        <p>Attacks on Wi-Fi networks can compromise the security and privacy of the
          network and its users. Here are some common attacks on Wi-Fi networks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Wi-Fi Eavesdropping</strong>: Attackers can intercept and capture
            wireless network traffic to eavesdrop on sensitive information, such as
            usernames, passwords, or financial data. This can be done using tools like
            packet sniffers or by setting up rogue access points to capture network
            traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</strong>: In a MitM attack, an
            attacker positions themselves between the wireless client and the access
            point, intercepting and potentially modifying the communication between
            them. This allows the attacker to capture sensitive information or inject
            malicious content into the communication.</li>
          <li><strong>Rogue Access Points</strong>: Attackers can set up unauthorized
            access points that mimic legitimate networks to trick users into connecting
            to them. Once connected, the attacker can capture sensitive information
            or launch further attacks on the connected devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks</strong>: Attackers can flood
            a Wi-Fi network with a high volume of traffic or malicious packets, causing
            the network to become overwhelmed and unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
          <li><strong>Password Cracking</strong>: Attackers can attempt to crack the
            Wi-Fi network's encryption key, such as the WEP or WPA/WPA2 passphrase,
            to gain unauthorized access to the network.</li>
          <li><strong>Wi-Fi Phishing</strong>: Attackers can create fake Wi-Fi networks
            with names similar to legitimate networks, tricking users into connecting
            to them. Once connected, the attacker can capture sensitive information
            or perform further attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Evil Twin Attacks</strong>: In an evil twin attack, an attacker
            sets up a rogue access point with the same name (SSID) as a legitimate
            network. When users unknowingly connect to the rogue access point, the
            attacker can intercept their traffic and capture sensitive information.</li>
