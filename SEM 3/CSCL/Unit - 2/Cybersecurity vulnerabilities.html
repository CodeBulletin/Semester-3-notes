       <h1>Cybersecurity vulnerabilities</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Cybersecurity vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses or flaws in computer
          systems, networks, or software that can be exploited by attackers to gain
          unauthorized access, steal data, disrupt operations, or cause other malicious
          activities. Some common types of vulnerabilities include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Software vulnerabilities</strong>: These are weaknesses in software
            applications or operating systems that can be exploited by attackers. Examples
            include buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and
            remote code execution vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Network vulnerabilities</strong>: These vulnerabilities exist
            in network infrastructure, such as routers, switches, and firewalls. They
            can allow attackers to intercept or manipulate network traffic, gain unauthorized
            access to systems, or launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Human vulnerabilities</strong>: People can be a weak link in cybersecurity.
            Human vulnerabilities include social engineering attacks, such as phishing,
            where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information
            or performing actions that compromise security.</li>
          <li><strong>Configuration vulnerabilities</strong>: Misconfigurations in systems
            or applications can create security vulnerabilities. For example, leaving
            default passwords unchanged, granting excessive privileges to users, or
            not applying security patches can expose systems to attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Hardware vulnerabilities</strong>: These vulnerabilities are inherent
            weaknesses in computer hardware components. They can be exploited to gain
            unauthorized access, extract sensitive information, or compromise the integrity
            of the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile device vulnerabilities</strong>: Mobile devices, such as
            smartphones and tablets, can have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
            These vulnerabilities can include insecure app permissions, weak authentication
            mechanisms, or unpatched software.</li>
