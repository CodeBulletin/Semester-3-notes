       <h1>DoS and DDoS</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>DoS stands for Denial of Service, while DDoS stands for Distributed Denial
          of Service. Both are types of cyber attacks that aim to disrupt or disable
          the availability of a targeted computer system, network, or website. Here's
          a brief explanation of each:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>DoS (Denial of Service)</strong>: In a DoS attack, the attacker
            overwhelms a target system or network with a flood of illegitimate requests
            or traffic, causing it to become unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate
            users. The attacker typically achieves this by exploiting vulnerabilities
            in the target's infrastructure or by consuming its resources, such as bandwidth,
            processing power, or memory. DoS attacks can be launched from a single
            source or multiple sources.</li>
          <li><strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</strong>: DDoS attacks are
            similar to DoS attacks but involve multiple sources, often a large number
            of compromised computers or devices called a botnet. The attacker controls
            these compromised devices remotely and coordinates them to simultaneously
            flood the target system or network with a massive volume of traffic or
            requests. DDoS attacks are more difficult to mitigate than DoS attacks
            because they distribute the attack traffic across multiple sources, making
            it challenging to block or filter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The primary goal of both DoS and DDoS attacks is to disrupt the availability
          of the targeted system or network, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate
          users. These attacks can have severe consequences, including financial
          losses, reputational damage, and disruption of critical services.</p>
        <p>To mitigate the impact of DoS and DDoS attacks, organizations can implement
          various security measures, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Network traffic monitoring and analysis to detect and block suspicious
            or malicious traffic patterns.</li>
          <li>Deploying firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion prevention systems
            to filter and manage incoming traffic.</li>
          <li>Utilizing content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute and absorb traffic
            during an attack.</li>
          <li>Implementing rate limiting or traffic shaping mechanisms to control the
            flow of incoming requests.</li>
          <li>Regularly updating and patching software and systems to address vulnerabilities
            that could be exploited in an attack.</li>
        </ul>
