       <h1>Password cracking</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Password cracking is the process of attempting to gain unauthorized access
          to a system or an account by systematically guessing or decrypting passwords.
          It involves using various techniques and tools to exploit vulnerabilities
          in password security.</p>
        <p>There are several methods used for password cracking:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Brute-force attacks</strong>: In a brute-force attack, an attacker
            systematically tries all possible combinations of characters until the
            correct password is found. This method can be time-consuming and resource-intensive,
            especially for complex passwords.</li>
          <li><strong>Dictionary attacks</strong>: In a dictionary attack, the attacker
            uses a precompiled list of commonly used passwords, known as a password
            dictionary or wordlist, to guess the password. This method is more efficient
            than brute-force attacks since it focuses on likely passwords based on
            common words, phrases, or patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Hybrid attacks</strong>: Hybrid attacks combine elements of brute-force
            and dictionary attacks. They involve trying different combinations of dictionary
            words, numbers, symbols, or variations of known passwords to increase the
            chances of success.</li>
          <li><strong>Rainbow table attacks</strong>: A rainbow table is a precomputed
            table of encrypted passwords and their corresponding plaintext values.
            Attackers can use these tables to quickly look up the plaintext value of
            a given password hash, bypassing the need for time-consuming encryption
            calculations.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing and social engineering</strong>: Instead of directly
            cracking passwords, attackers may use phishing techniques or social engineering
            to trick users into revealing their passwords willingly. This can involve
            creating fake login pages or impersonating legitimate entities to deceive
            users into providing their credentials.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's important to note that password cracking is typically performed by
          malicious actors seeking unauthorized access to systems or accounts. However,
          there are legitimate use cases for password cracking as well, such as when
          individuals or organizations need to test the strength of their own passwords
          or assess the security of their systems.</p>
