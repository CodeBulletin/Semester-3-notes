        <p><strong>Cyber Squatting</strong>: Cyber squatting refers to the practice
          of registering or using domain names that are similar to existing trademarks
          or popular brands with the intention of profiting from the confusion or
          selling the domain back to the legitimate owner at an inflated price. It
          can lead to brand dilution, reputation damage, and financial losses for
          the legitimate trademark holders.</p>
        <p><strong>Cyber Warfare</strong>: Cyber warfare involves the use of cyber
          attacks by nation-states or state-sponsored groups to disrupt or damage
          the computer systems, networks, and infrastructure of other countries.
          It can target critical infrastructure, military systems, government networks,
          or even financial institutions. The aim is to gain a strategic advantage
          or undermine the operations and capabilities of the targeted nation.</p>
        <p><strong>Cyber Terrorism</strong>: Cyber terrorism refers to the use of
          cyber attacks by individuals or groups with political, ideological, or
          religious motivations to create fear, panic, or disruption. It can involve
          hacking into systems, defacing websites, spreading propaganda, or launching
          attacks that cause physical harm or economic damage. The goal is to achieve
          political or ideological objectives through the use of technology.</p>
        <p><strong>Cybercrime</strong>: Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of criminal
          activities conducted through the internet or computer networks. It includes
          activities such as hacking, identity theft, fraud, phishing, ransomware
          attacks, and online scams. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in systems
          and networks to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information,
          or extort money from individuals or organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>Cyber Offenses</strong>: Cyber offenses refer to illegal activities
          committed using computers or the internet that may not necessarily fall
          under the category of cybercrime. This can include activities such as unauthorized
          access to computer systems, distribution of malicious software, copyright
          infringement, and online harassment. While not all cyber offenses are considered
          criminal acts, they can still cause harm and may be subject to legal consequences.</p>
