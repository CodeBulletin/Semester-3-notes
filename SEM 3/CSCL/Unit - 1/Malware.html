        <p>Trojans, viruses, and worms are all types of malicious software (malware)
          that can infect computer systems and cause harm. However, they differ in
          their specific characteristics and methods of propagation. Here's an overview
          of each:</p>
        <p><strong>Trojans</strong>: Trojans, short for Trojan horses, are a type
          of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software or files to deceive
          users into executing or installing them. Once activated, Trojans can perform
          various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, gaining
          unauthorized access to the system, or allowing remote control by an attacker.
          Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not self-replicate.</p>
        <p><strong>Viruses</strong>: Viruses are malicious programs that can replicate
          themselves by attaching to other files or programs. They spread by infecting
          host files and can be transmitted through various means, such as email
          attachments, infected software downloads, or compromised websites. Viruses
          can cause damage by corrupting or deleting files, disrupting system operations,
          or spreading to other systems when infected files are shared.</p>
        <p><strong>Worms</strong>: Worms are self-replicating malware that can spread
          across computer networks without requiring user interaction. They exploit
          vulnerabilities in operating systems or network protocols to propagate
          and infect other systems. Worms can consume network bandwidth, overload
          servers, or carry out malicious activities, such as stealing data or installing
          backdoors for remote access. Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach
          themselves to host files.</p>
