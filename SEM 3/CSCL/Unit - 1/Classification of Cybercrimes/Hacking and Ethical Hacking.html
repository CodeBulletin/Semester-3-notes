       <h1>Hacking and Ethical Hacking</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Hacking, the unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or devices,
          is generally illegal and unethical. It involves exploiting vulnerabilities
          to steal data, disrupt services, or cause damage. Contrastingly, ethical
          hacking, or white hat hacking, is a legal and authorized activity conducted
          by cybersecurity professionals to improve system security.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Ethical Hacking</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Identify and fix vulnerabilities in systems,
            networks, or applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Approach</strong>: Ethical hackers use structured methods to test
            security, simulating real-world attacks to breach defenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: Provides insights and recommendations for enhancing
            security measures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Ethical hacking is crucial for maintaining the security and resilience
          of computer systems and networks, helping organizations preemptively address
          vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Other Types of Hackers</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Black Hat Hackers</strong>: Engage in illegal hacking for personal
            gain, causing harm or chaos. They might commit identity theft, financial
            fraud, or spread malware.</li>
          <li><strong>Gray Hat Hackers</strong>: Operate between ethical and malicious
            hacking. They hack without authorization but usually without harmful intent,
            often exposing vulnerabilities to raise awareness or improve security,
            though their actions can still be technically illegal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Each type of hacker has distinct motives and methods, impacting cybersecurity
          in various ways.</p>
