       <h1>Hacking and Ethical Hacking</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Hacking refers to the act of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems,
          networks, or devices with the intent to exploit vulnerabilities, steal
          sensitive information, disrupt services, or cause damage. It is generally
          considered illegal and unethical.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, ethical hacking, also known as white hat hacking or
          penetration testing, involves authorized and legal hacking activities performed
          by cybersecurity professionals. Ethical hackers use their skills and knowledge
          to identify vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications.
          They conduct these activities with the permission of the system owners
          to help improve security and protect against potential cyber threats.</p>
        <p>Ethical hackers follow a structured and systematic approach to identify
          weaknesses in security controls, such as weak passwords, misconfigured
          systems, or software vulnerabilities. They use various techniques, tools,
          and methodologies to simulate real-world attacks and attempt to breach
          the system's defenses. By doing so, they can provide valuable insights
          and recommendations to enhance security measures and mitigate potential
          risks.</p>
        <p>Ethical hacking plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and resilience
          of computer systems and networks. It helps organizations identify and address
          vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. Ethical hackers
          often work closely with system administrators, security teams, and organizations
          to assess and strengthen their security posture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Black Hat Hackers</strong>: Black hat hackers are individuals
          who engage in hacking activities with malicious intent and for personal
          gain. They exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications
          to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, cause damage,
          or disrupt services. Black hat hackers often engage in illegal activities,
          such as identity theft, financial fraud, or spreading malware. Their actions
          are driven by personal gain, financial motives, or even for causing harm
          or chaos.</p>
        <p><strong>Gray Hat Hackers</strong>: Gray hat hackers fall somewhere between
          black hat and white hat hackers. They engage in hacking activities without
          explicit authorization but without malicious intent. Gray hat hackers may
          identify vulnerabilities in computer systems or networks and exploit them
          to gain unauthorized access or expose security flaws. However, unlike black
          hat hackers, their intentions are not primarily malicious or for personal
          gain. Gray hat hackers may expose vulnerabilities to raise awareness, prompt
          system owners to improve security, or even offer their services to help
          fix the vulnerabilities they discover. While their actions may be technically
          illegal, they often have a more ethical motive behind their activities</p>
