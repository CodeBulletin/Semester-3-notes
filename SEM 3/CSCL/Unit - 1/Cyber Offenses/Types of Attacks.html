       <h1>Types of Attacks</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p><strong>Passive Attack</strong>: A passive attack is a type of cyber attack
          where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to information or
          systems without altering or disrupting the target. In a passive attack,
          the attacker's goal is to eavesdrop on communications, gather sensitive
          information, or gain knowledge about the target's systems or network architecture.
          Examples of passive attacks include sniffing network traffic to capture
          data, monitoring user activities, or conducting reconnaissance to gather
          information for future attacks. Passive attacks can be difficult to detect
          since they do not cause immediate disruptions or changes to the target.</p>
        <p><strong>Active Attack</strong>: An active attack is a type of cyber attack
          where an attacker actively interacts with the target system or network
          to compromise its security, disrupt operations, or gain unauthorized access.
          Unlike passive attacks, active attacks involve altering, modifying, or
          injecting malicious data or commands into the target. Examples of active
          attacks include malware infections, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, SQL
          injections, or unauthorized access attempts. Active attacks are more noticeable
          and can cause immediate harm or disruptions to the target.</p>
        <p><strong>Inside Attack</strong>: An inside attack, also known as an insider
          attack, occurs when an individual with authorized access to a system or
          network misuses their privileges to carry out malicious activities. This
          can include employees, contractors, or anyone with legitimate access to
          the target organization's resources. Inside attacks can involve stealing
          sensitive information, sabotaging systems, or causing damage from within.
          Insider attacks can be challenging to detect since the attacker already
          has authorized access, making it important for organizations to implement
          proper access controls, monitoring systems, and employee awareness programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Outside Attack</strong>: An outside attack, also known as an external
          attack, refers to cyber attacks that originate from outside the target
          organization's network or systems. These attacks are typically carried
          out by individuals or groups who do not have authorized access to the target.
          Outside attacks can include various techniques such as hacking, phishing,
          social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems or networks.
          The goal of outside attacks can range from stealing data, gaining unauthorized
          access, or disrupting operations. Organizations need to implement robust
          security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
          regular vulnerability assessments, to protect against outside attacks.</p>
