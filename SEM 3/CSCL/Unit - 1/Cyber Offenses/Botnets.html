       <h1>Botnets</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Botnets are networks of compromised computers or devices that are under
          the control of a malicious actor, known as the botmaster or bot herder.
          These compromised devices, often referred to as "bots" or "zombies," are
          typically infected with malware that allows the botmaster to remotely control
          them without the knowledge or consent of their owners.</p>
        <p>Botnets are created by infecting a large number of devices, which can
          include computers, servers, smartphones, IoT devices, or even routers.
          The malware used to infect these devices is often spread through various
          means, such as phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software
          vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Once a device is infected and becomes part of a botnet, it can be used
          to carry out various malicious activities, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks</strong>: Botnets
            can be used to launch DDoS attacks, where a large number of bots simultaneously
            flood a target website or network with traffic, overwhelming its resources
            and causing it to become inaccessible.</li>
          <li><strong>Spamming and Phishing</strong>: Botnets can be used to send out
            massive volumes of spam emails or phishing messages, often promoting scams,
            spreading malware, or attempting to steal sensitive information.</li>
          <li><strong>Credential Stuffing and Brute-Force Attacks</strong>: Botnets
            can be used to automate credential stuffing attacks, where stolen usernames
            and passwords are systematically tested against various online services
            to gain unauthorized access. They can also be used to launch brute-force
            attacks, attempting to guess passwords through automated trial-and-error
            methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Click Fraud and Ad Fraud</strong>: Botnets can be used to generate
            fraudulent clicks on online advertisements or manipulate online traffic,
            leading to financial losses for advertisers or artificially inflating website
            traffic statistics.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Theft and Espionage</strong>: Botnets can be used to steal
            sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, or intellectual
            property, from infected devices or networks.</li>
        </ol>
