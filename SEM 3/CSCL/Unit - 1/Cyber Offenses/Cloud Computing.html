       <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Cloud computing involves delivering hosted services over the internet
          and is categorized into IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. It can be public, offering
          services to anyone on the internet, or private, serving a limited number
          with specific access. Cloud computing aims to provide easy, scalable access
          to computing resources and IT services, with an infrastructure comprising
          hardware and software components. It's often likened to utility or on-demand
          computing and is symbolized by a cloud in diagrams to represent the internet.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>How it Works</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front End</strong>: Includes client devices, browsers, networks,
              and cloud software applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Back End</strong>: Comprises databases, servers, and computers,
              functioning as a data repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Server</strong>: Manages communication, using protocols
              and middleware for connectivity between client devices and cloud servers,
              with dedicated servers for each application.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Facilitates easy resource adjustment based
              on needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Savings</strong>: Reduces the need for physical infrastructure
              and operates on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Allows application and data access from
              anywhere with internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability and Availability</strong>: Offers robust infrastructure,
              redundancy, backups, and SLAs.</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: Implements advanced security, encryption, and
              regular audits.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Internet Dependency</strong>: Relies on internet connectivity,
              with disruptions affecting access.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Control</strong>: Users have restricted control over the
              infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Security Concerns</strong>: Raises issues regarding data
              privacy, ownership, and compliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential Downtime</strong>: Can experience temporary disruptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Lock-In</strong>: Switching providers or migrating data
              can be complex and costly.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cybercrimes in Cloud Computing</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Breaches</strong>: Targeting sensitive data stored in the
              cloud.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Hijacking</strong>: Using stolen credentials to misuse
              cloud services.</li>
            <li><strong>Insider Threats</strong>: Authorized individuals misusing access
              for malicious actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Attacks on Providers</strong>: Targeting cloud service providers
              to compromise infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Loss</strong>: Due to technical failures, errors, or malicious
              actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Malware and Ransomware</strong>: Using cloud services to distribute
              harmful software.</li>
          </ol>
