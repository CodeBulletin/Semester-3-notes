       <h1>Cyber Stalking</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Cyberstalking refers to the persistent and unwanted pursuit or harassment
          of an individual through online channels. It involves the use of digital
          communication platforms, such as social media, email, instant messaging,
          or online forums, to stalk, intimidate, threaten, or monitor the victim.</p>
        <p>Cyberstalkers may engage in various behaviors to harass their victims,
          including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Unwanted Communication</strong>: Sending excessive, threatening,
            or harassing messages, emails, or comments to the victim. This can include
            explicit or offensive content, hate speech, or personal attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring and Surveillance</strong>: Cyberstalkers may closely
            monitor the victim's online activities, such as tracking their social media
            posts, checking their location through geolocation data, or monitoring
            their online presence through fake accounts or aliases.</li>
          <li><strong>Impersonation</strong>: Cyberstalkers may create fake profiles
            or impersonate the victim online to spread false information, damage their
            reputation, or manipulate others' perception of the victim.</li>
          <li><strong>Doxing</strong>: Doxing involves publicly revealing or publishing
            the victim's personal information, such as their home address, phone number,
            or workplace, with the intention of causing harm or facilitating further
            harassment.</li>
          <li><strong>Online Threats</strong>: Cyberstalkers may make threats of physical
            harm, violence, or even death towards the victim. These threats can be
            conveyed through messages, emails, or public posts.</li>
