       <h1>Social Engneering</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Social engineering is a technique used by cybercriminals to manipulate
          and deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, performing
          certain actions, or granting unauthorized access to systems or networks.
          It involves exploiting human psychology and trust to bypass traditional
          security measures.</p>
        <p>Rather than relying on technical vulnerabilities, social engineering targets
          the human element, taking advantage of people's natural inclination to
          trust and help others. Cybercriminals may impersonate trusted individuals
          or organizations, create a sense of urgency or fear, or use persuasive
          tactics to manipulate their targets.</p>
        <p>Common examples of social engineering techniques include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: Cybercriminals send fraudulent emails, messages,
            or create fake websites that appear to be from reputable sources. They
            trick recipients into providing sensitive information, such as passwords,
            credit card details, or social security numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Pretexting</strong>: The attacker creates a false scenario or
            pretext to gain the target's trust. They may pose as a co-worker, customer
            service representative, or authority figure to extract information or convince
            the target to take certain actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Baiting</strong>: The attacker entices the target with an appealing
            offer or incentive, such as a free download, gift, or prize. The bait is
            designed to lure the target into clicking on a malicious link or downloading
            malware.</li>
          <li><strong>Tailgating</strong>: The attacker gains physical access to a restricted
            area by following closely behind an authorized person. They exploit the
            trust and courtesy of individuals to gain entry without proper authorization.</li>
          <li><strong>Impersonation</strong>: The attacker pretends to be someone else,
            such as a colleague, IT technician, or company executive, to deceive the
            target into providing sensitive information or granting access to systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Social engineering attacks can be highly effective because they exploit
          human vulnerabilities rather than technical weaknesses. To protect against
          social engineering, it is important to be cautious of unsolicited requests
          for information, verify the identity of individuals or organizations before
          sharing sensitive data, and maintain a healthy skepticism towards unexpected
          or too-good-to-be-true offers. Additionally, organizations should provide
          regular training and awareness programs to educate employees about social
          engineering techniques and how to recognize and respond to them.</p>
