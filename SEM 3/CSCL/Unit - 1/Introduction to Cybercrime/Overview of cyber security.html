       <h1>Overview of cyber security</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks,
          and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. It involves implementing
          measures to prevent, detect, and respond to threats in the digital realm.</p>
        <p>The importance of cybersecurity has grown significantly as our reliance
          on technology has increased. With the rise of interconnected devices and
          the internet, the potential for cyber threats has also expanded. Cybersecurity
          aims to safeguard sensitive information, such as personal data, financial
          records, and intellectual property, from being compromised or misused.</p>
        <p>Key components of cybersecurity include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Prevention</strong>: This involves implementing security measures,
            such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls, to prevent unauthorized
            access and protect against malware and other cyber threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Detection</strong>: Cybersecurity systems and tools are used to
            monitor networks and systems for any signs of suspicious activity or breaches.
            Intrusion detection systems, log analysis, and threat intelligence are
            commonly employed to identify potential threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Response</strong>: In the event of a cyber attack or breach, a
            well-defined incident response plan is crucial. This involves containing
            the attack, mitigating the damage, and restoring systems and data to normal
            operations. It may also involve cooperating with law enforcement agencies
            and conducting forensic investigations.</li>
          <li><strong>Education and Awareness</strong>: Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility,
            and individuals play a vital role in maintaining a secure digital environment.
            Education and awareness programs help users understand best practices for
            online safety, such as creating strong passwords, avoiding phishing scams,
            and regularly updating software.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cybersecurity is an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring,
          adaptation, and improvement. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines
          technology, policy, and human factors to protect against evolving cyber
          threats. By implementing robust cybersecurity measures, organizations and
          individuals can minimize the risk of cyber attacks and protect their valuable
          assets.</p>
