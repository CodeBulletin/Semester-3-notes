      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2><strong>1. Cybercrime against individual</strong>:&nbsp;</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>E-Mail Spoofing and Other Online Fraud</strong>: E-mail spoofing
            is a technique used by cybercriminals to forge the sender's address in
            an email to make it appear as if it is coming from a different source.
            This is often done to deceive recipients into believing the email is legitimate
            and to trick them into revealing sensitive information or performing certain
            actions. Online fraud encompasses various fraudulent activities conducted
            over the internet, such as identity theft, advance-fee fraud, or online
            scams that aim to deceive individuals or organizations for financial gain.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: Phishing is a type of cyber attack where cybercriminals
            send fraudulent emails, messages, or create fake websites that appear to
            be from reputable sources. The goal is to trick recipients into providing
            sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card details, or social
            security numbers. Phishing attacks often use social engineering techniques
            to manipulate victims into taking actions that benefit the attacker.</li>
          <li><strong>Spamming</strong>: Spamming refers to the mass distribution of
            unsolicited and often unwanted messages, typically through email. These
            messages can contain advertisements, scams, or malicious content. Spamming
            is not only a nuisance but can also be used to spread malware, phishing
            attempts, or fraudulent schemes.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberdefamation</strong>: Cyberdefamation involves the act of
            defaming or damaging someone's reputation through online platforms, such
            as social media, websites, or forums. It can include false statements,
            rumors, or malicious content that harms an individual's or organization's
            reputation. Cyberdefamation can have serious consequences for the victim,
            including personal and professional damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberstalking and Harassment</strong>: Cyberstalking refers to
            the persistent and unwanted pursuit or harassment of an individual through
            online channels, such as social media, email, or messaging platforms. It
            involves repeated threats, intimidation, or monitoring of the victim's
            online activities. Cyber harassment encompasses a broader range of online
            harassment, including cyberbullying, hate speech, or the dissemination
            of explicit or private content without consent.</li>
          <li><strong>Computer Sabotage</strong>: Computer sabotage involves intentional
            actions to disrupt or damage computer systems, networks, or data. This
            can include spreading malware, launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
            to overwhelm systems, or tampering with critical infrastructure. Computer
            sabotage can have severe consequences, including financial losses, service
            disruptions, or compromise of sensitive information.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><strong>2. Cybercrime against property</strong>:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Credit Card Frauds</strong>: Credit card fraud refers to the unauthorized
            use of someone else's credit card information to make fraudulent transactions
            or obtain goods or services without the cardholder's consent. This can
            involve stealing physical credit cards, obtaining card details through
            phishing or hacking, or using counterfeit cards. Credit card fraud can
            result in financial losses for the cardholder and can also impact businesses
            and financial institutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Property Crime</strong>: Intellectual property (IP)
            crime involves the infringement or unauthorized use of intellectual property
            rights, such as copyrights, trademarks, or patents. This can include activities
            like counterfeiting, piracy, or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted
            material, such as movies, music, software, or counterfeit products. IP
            crime not only causes financial losses to creators and rights holders but
            also undermines innovation, creativity, and fair competition.</li>
          <li><strong>Internet Time Theft</strong>: Internet time theft refers to the
            unauthorized use of an employer's internet resources or time for personal
            purposes during work hours. This can include activities like excessive
            personal internet browsing, accessing social media, or engaging in online
            shopping while on the job. Internet time theft can result in decreased
            productivity, wasted resources, and potential security risks for organizations.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><strong>3. Cybercrime against organization</strong>:&nbsp;</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Unauthorized</strong>  <strong>Accessing of Computer</strong>: Unauthorized
            accessing of a computer refers to gaining unauthorized entry into a computer
            system, network, or device without proper authorization. This can involve
            bypassing security measures, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen
            credentials to gain access to sensitive information or perform malicious
            activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Password Sniffing</strong>: Password sniffing is a technique used
            by cybercriminals to intercept and capture passwords or login credentials
            as they are transmitted over a network. This can be done by monitoring
            network traffic or using specialized software or hardware devices. Password
            sniffing allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts
            or sensitive information.</li>
          <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks</strong>: Denial-of-Service attacks
            aim to disrupt or disable the normal functioning of a computer system,
            network, or website by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic or requests.
            This prevents legitimate users from accessing the targeted resource. Distributed
            Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks involve multiple compromised devices,
            forming a botnet, to launch the attack.</li>
          <li><strong>Virus</strong>: A virus is a type of malicious software that can
            replicate itself and spread from one computer to another. It typically
            attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and can cause damage by
            corrupting or deleting data, disrupting system operations, or spreading
            to other systems. Viruses often require user interaction or the execution
            of infected files to propagate.</li>
          <li><strong>E-Mail Bombing</strong>: E-Mail bombing involves sending a large
            volume of emails to a targeted individual or organization, overwhelming
            their email server and causing disruption. This can result in the recipient's
            inbox being flooded with unwanted emails, making it difficult to receive
            or send legitimate messages.</li>
          <li><strong>Salami Attack</strong>: A salami attack is a type of cybercrime
            where small, unnoticed amounts of money or data are fraudulently taken
            from multiple accounts or transactions. The attacker accumulates these
            small amounts over time, similar to slicing thin pieces from a salami,
            hence the name.</li>
          <li><strong>Logic Bomb</strong>: A logic bomb is a piece of code or software
            that is intentionally inserted into a system to execute a malicious action
            when specific conditions are met. It remains dormant until triggered by
            a predefined event or date. Logic bombs can be used to delete data, disrupt
            operations, or cause other malicious activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Trojan Horse</strong>: A Trojan horse is a type of malware that
            disguises itself as legitimate software or files to deceive users into
            executing or installing it. Once activated, it can perform various malicious
            actions, such as stealing sensitive information, providing unauthorized
            access to the attacker, or damaging the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Diddling</strong>: Data diddling involves unauthorized manipulation
            or alteration of data before, during, or after it is entered into a computer
            system. This can be done to commit fraud, conceal activities, or cause
            financial harm by modifying or deleting critical information.</li>
          <li><strong>Industrial Spying</strong>: Industrial spying, also known as corporate
            espionage, refers to the unauthorized gathering of confidential or proprietary
            information from a competitor or another organization for competitive advantage.
            This can involve hacking into computer systems, stealing trade secrets,
            or conducting surveillance to gain valuable insights or intellectual property.</li>
          <li><strong>Computer Network Intrusions</strong>: Computer network intrusions
            involve unauthorized access or intrusion into computer networks, systems,
            or devices. Intruders may exploit vulnerabilities, use stolen credentials,
            or employ various techniques to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information,
            disrupt operations, or carry out malicious activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Software Piracy</strong>: Software piracy refers to the unauthorized
            copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted software without the permission
            of the software's owner. This can involve downloading or sharing software
            from unauthorized sources, using cracked or counterfeit software, or bypassing
            licensing restrictions. Software piracy deprives software developers of
            revenue and violates intellectual property rights.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><strong>4. Cybercrime against society</strong>:&nbsp;</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Forgery</strong>: Forgery refers to the act of creating or altering
            documents, objects, or information with the intent to deceive or defraud
            others. In the context of cybercrime, forgery can involve creating fake
            digital documents, such as counterfeit identification cards, passports,
            or financial records. It can also include forging digital signatures or
            manipulating electronic records to misrepresent information or gain unauthorized
            access to systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberterrorism</strong>: Cyberterrorism involves the use of cyber
            attacks by individuals or groups with political, ideological, or religious
            motivations to create fear, panic, or disruption on a large scale. Cyberterrorists
            may target critical infrastructure, government networks, or financial institutions
            with the aim of causing significant damage, disruption, or loss of life.
            Their actions can include hacking, spreading malware, launching denial-of-service
            attacks, or disseminating propaganda to further their political or ideological
            objectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Jacking</strong>: Web jacking, also known as website hijacking,
            refers to the unauthorized takeover or control of a website or web server
            by an attacker. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the website's
            security, gaining unauthorized access to the server, or manipulating the
            website's content or functionality. Web jacking can be done for various
            reasons, such as defacing the website, stealing sensitive information,
            or using the compromised website for malicious activities.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><strong>5. Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroup</strong>:&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroups refer to illegal activities that
          are conducted through Usenet, a decentralized network of discussion forums
          and message boards. While Usenet itself is a legitimate platform for exchanging
          information and engaging in discussions, it can also be misused for criminal
          purposes. Here are some examples of crimes that can occur on Usenet:</p>
        <p><strong>Distribution of Illegal Content</strong>: Usenet newsgroups can
          be used to distribute illegal content, such as copyrighted material, pirated
          software, child pornography, or other illicit materials. Users may share
          or download these materials through Usenet, which is a violation of copyright
          laws and can lead to legal consequences.</p>
        <p><strong>Fraud and Scams</strong>: Usenet can be a breeding ground for
          various types of fraud and scams. This can include phishing attempts, where
          users are tricked into revealing personal information or login credentials,
          or fraudulent schemes that promise financial gains or products that are
          never delivered. Scammers may use Usenet to target unsuspecting individuals
          and carry out their fraudulent activities.</p>
        <p><strong>Harassment and Hate Speech</strong>: Usenet newsgroups can be
          used as platforms for harassment, hate speech, or the dissemination of
          offensive or harmful content. Users may engage in cyberbullying, spread
          discriminatory messages, or incite violence or hatred towards specific
          individuals or groups. Such activities are not only morally wrong but can
          also be illegal in many jurisdictions.</p>
        <p><strong>Cyberstalking</strong>: Usenet can be misused for cyberstalking,
          where individuals are targeted with persistent and unwanted online attention,
          threats, or harassment. Cyberstalkers may use Usenet newsgroups to track
          their victims, gather personal information, or publicly harass them.</p>
