        <h2>(a) Discuss different types of Intrusion detection system. How is Intrusion detection system different from Intrusion prevention system? Identify purpose of SNORT.</h2>
        <p>Different Types of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network-based IDS (NIDS)</strong>: NIDS monitors network traffic
            and analyzes it for suspicious patterns or anomalies. It operates at the
            network level and can detect attacks such as port scanning, DoS attacks,
            and network-based exploits.</li>
          <li><strong>Host-based IDS (HIDS)</strong>: HIDS is installed on individual
            hosts or servers and monitors their activities and system logs. It can
            detect attacks that target specific hosts, such as unauthorized access
            attempts, file modifications, or malicious software installations.</li>
          <li><strong>Anomaly-based IDS</strong>: Anomaly-based IDS compares the current
            behavior of a system or network to a baseline of normal behavior. It detects
            deviations from the expected patterns and raises alerts for potential intrusions
            or abnormal activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Signature-based IDS</strong>: Signature-based IDS uses a database
            of known attack patterns or signatures to identify malicious activities.
            It compares network traffic or system logs against these signatures and
            generates alerts when a match is found.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) vs. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):</p>
        <p>An IDS is designed to detect and alert about potential intrusions or security
          breaches. It monitors network traffic or system activities, analyzes them
          for suspicious patterns, and generates alerts for further investigation.
          However, it does not actively block or prevent the detected attacks.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) not only detects
          intrusions but also takes proactive measures to prevent them. It can automatically
          block or mitigate the detected attacks by modifying firewall rules, blocking
          IP addresses, or terminating suspicious connections.</p>
        <p>Purpose of SNORT:</p>
        <p>SNORT is an open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system.
          Its purpose is to monitor network traffic, analyze it for potential threats
          or attacks, and generate alerts. SNORT uses a combination of signature-based
          and anomaly-based detection methods to identify malicious activities. It
          is highly customizable and widely used for network security monitoring
          and threat detection.</p>
        <h2>(b) What do you mean by access management? Explain all 3 access control models and elaborate with suitable examples.</h2>
        <p>Access management refers to the process of controlling and managing user
          access to resources within a system or organization. It involves defining
          and enforcing policies, procedures, and technologies to ensure that users
          have appropriate access privileges based on their roles and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>There are three commonly used access control models:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong>: In DAC, access control
            is based on the discretion of the resource owner. The owner determines
            who can access the resource and what level of access they have. For example,
            in a file system with DAC, the owner of a file can set permissions to allow
            specific users or groups to read, write, or execute the file.</li>
          <li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>: MAC is a more rigid access
            control model where access decisions are based on predefined security labels
            and rules. The system administrator or security policy defines the access
            controls, and users have limited control over access permissions. MAC is
            commonly used in high-security environments, such as government or military
            systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: RBAC assigns access
            permissions based on predefined roles. Users are assigned roles based on
            their job functions, and access rights are associated with these roles.
            For example, in an RBAC system, a user with the role of "manager" may have
            access to certain resources and privileges that are not available to a
            user with the role of "employee."</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each access control model provides a different level of granularity and
          control over access permissions. The choice of model depends on the specific
          security requirements and organizational needs.</p>
