        <h2>(a) Elaborate the purpose of firewall. How can we classify firewalls according to different OSI Layers? Contrast and compare stateful and stateless firewall.</h2>
        <p>A firewall is a network security device that acts as a barrier between
          an internal network and external networks, such as the internet. Its primary
          purpose is to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic
          based on predetermined security rules. Here are some key purposes of a
          firewall:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network Security</strong>: Firewalls help protect a network from
            unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential threats by filtering
            and blocking unwanted traffic. They act as a first line of defense against
            external attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Firewalls enforce access control policies
            by allowing or denying network traffic based on predefined rules. This
            helps prevent unauthorized users or malicious entities from gaining access
            to sensitive resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Traffic Monitoring</strong>: Firewalls monitor network traffic
            and log information about incoming and outgoing connections. This allows
            network administrators to analyze and identify potential security breaches
            or suspicious activities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Classification of Firewalls according to OSI Layers</strong>:</p>
        <p>Firewalls can be classified into different types based on the OSI (Open
          Systems Interconnection) model layers they operate on:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3) Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls operate
            at the network layer and examine IP addresses, ports, and protocols to
            make filtering decisions. Examples include packet-filtering firewalls and
            network address translation (NAT) firewalls.</li>
          <li><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4) Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls
            operate at the transport layer and can inspect data packets beyond IP addresses
            and ports. They can analyze the contents of packets to make filtering decisions.
            Examples include stateful firewalls and circuit-level gateways.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Layer (Layer 7) Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls
            operate at the application layer and can inspect the content of data packets
            at the application level. They can make filtering decisions based on specific
            application protocols. Examples include proxy firewalls and application-level
            gateways.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Contrasting and Comparing Stateful and Stateless Firewalls:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Stateful Firewall</strong>: A stateful firewall, also known as
            a dynamic packet-filtering firewall, keeps track of the state of network
            connections. It maintains a record of established connections and allows
            incoming packets that are part of an existing connection. Stateful firewalls
            can make filtering decisions based on the connection state, such as allowing
            response packets to return to the original sender.</li>
          <li><strong>Stateless Firewall</strong>: A stateless firewall, also known
            as a static packet-filtering firewall, examines each packet individually
            without considering the context or state of the connection. It filters
            packets based on predetermined rules, such as source and destination IP
            addresses, ports, and protocols. Stateless firewalls do not maintain connection
            state information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The main difference between stateful and stateless firewalls is that stateful
          firewalls have the ability to track and manage the state of network connections,
          allowing them to make more sophisticated filtering decisions. Stateless
          firewalls, on the other hand, only consider individual packets and do not
          maintain connection state information.</p>
        <h2>(b) Enlist web application vulnerabilities. Elaborate Cross site scripting And Cross site request forgery with suitable examples.</h2>
        <p>Web applications can be vulnerable to various security flaws that can
          be exploited by attackers. Some common web application vulnerabilities
          include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting</strong> (XSS): XSS occurs when an attacker
            injects malicious scripts into a web application, which are then executed
            by unsuspecting users. This allows the attacker to steal sensitive information,
            such as login credentials or session cookies, or manipulate the content
            displayed to users. For example, an attacker could inject a script into
            a comment section of a website, and when other users view the comments,
            the script gets executed in their browsers.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery</strong> (CSRF): CSRF involves tricking
            a user's browser into making unintended and unauthorized requests to a
            web application on behalf of the attacker. This can lead to actions being
            performed without the user's knowledge or consent. For example, an attacker
            could send a malicious link to a victim, and if the victim clicks on it
            while authenticated to a vulnerable website, the attacker can perform actions
            on the victim's behalf, such as changing their password or making unauthorized
            transactions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To protect against these vulnerabilities, web developers can implement
          security measures such as input validation and sanitization, output encoding,
          and implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Regular
          security testing and patching of vulnerabilities are also crucial to ensure
          the security of web applications.</p>
