       <h1>Q4</h1>

        <h2>(a) Explain key logging? Enlist types of keyloggers and elaborate their working. Also identify the tool that can detect keylogger.</h2>
        <p>Keylogging, also known as keystroke logging, is a technique used to capture
          and record keystrokes made on a computer or mobile device. It can be used
          for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activities or parental
          control, but it can also be employed maliciously to steal sensitive information
          like passwords, credit card details, or personal messages.</p>
        <p>Types of keyloggers:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Hardware Keyloggers</strong>: Hardware keyloggers are physical
            devices that are connected between the keyboard and the computer. They
            intercept and record keystrokes before they reach the computer's operating
            system. These devices can be discreetly installed by an attacker and are
            difficult to detect without physical inspection.</li>
          <li><strong>Software Keyloggers</strong>: Software keyloggers are programs
            or malware that are installed on a computer or mobile device. They can
            be installed through malicious downloads, email attachments, or infected
            websites. Software keyloggers run in the background and record keystrokes,
            which are then sent to the attacker for analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Memory-based Keyloggers</strong>: Memory-based keyloggers exploit
            vulnerabilities in the computer's memory to capture keystrokes. They target
            the memory space where keystrokes are temporarily stored before being processed
            by the operating system. By accessing this memory space, the keylogger
            can retrieve the keystrokes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Detecting keyloggers:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>One tool that can detect keyloggers is an anti-keylogger software. These
          programs monitor the system for any suspicious activities related to keylogging.
          They can detect and block keyloggers from capturing keystrokes or sending
          the recorded data to unauthorized parties. Examples of anti-keylogger software
          include Zemana AntiLogger, SpyShelter, and KeyScrambler.</p>
        <h2>(b) Elaborate the purpose of a proxy server? Contrast anonymizer with proxy server.</h2>
        <p>A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client device (such as
          a computer) and the internet. Its main purpose is to facilitate communication
          between the client and other servers on the internet. Here are some common
          purposes of a proxy server:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Anonymity and Privacy</strong>: Proxy servers can provide anonymity
            by masking the client's IP address. When a client accesses the internet
            through a proxy server, the server's IP address is visible to the websites
            or services being accessed, while the client's IP address remains hidden.
            This helps protect the client's privacy and identity.</li>
          <li><strong>Caching</strong>: Proxy servers can cache web pages and other
            internet resources. When a client requests a resource that has been previously
            accessed, the proxy server can serve the cached copy instead of retrieving
            it from the original server. This improves performance and reduces bandwidth
            usage.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Filtering</strong>: Proxy servers can be used to filter
            or block certain types of content. Organizations often use proxy servers
            to restrict access to specific websites or to filter out malicious or inappropriate
            content. This helps enforce acceptable use policies and enhance security.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Contrasting anonymizers with proxy servers</strong>:</p>
        <p>An anonymizer is a specific type of proxy server that focuses on providing
          anonymity by hiding the client's IP address. Anonymizers are designed to
          prevent websites or services from identifying the client's true location
          or identity. They achieve this by routing the client's internet traffic
          through multiple servers, making it difficult to trace back to the original
          client.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a proxy server has a broader range of purposes beyond
          just anonymity. While some proxy servers may offer anonymity features,
          their primary function is to act as an intermediary between the client
          and the internet, facilitating communication, caching, or content filtering.</p>
