        <h2>(a) Elaborate DoS attack. Explain Flood attack, Smurf attack and teardrop attack in DOS. Compare DDos with PDOS.</h2>
        <p>A DoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning
          of a computer system, network, or service by overwhelming it with a flood
          of illegitimate requests or by exploiting vulnerabilities. Here are three
          types of DoS attacks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Flood Attack</strong>: In a flood attack, the attacker floods
            the target system or network with a massive volume of traffic, overwhelming
            its resources and causing it to become unresponsive or crash. This can
            be achieved by sending a large number of requests or by exploiting vulnerabilities
            that allow amplification of the attack traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Smurf Attack</strong>: In a smurf attack, the attacker spoofs
            the source IP address and sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
            echo request packets to a network's broadcast address. The network then
            responds to these requests, flooding the target system with a large volume
            of ICMP echo reply packets, causing it to become overwhelmed and unresponsive.</li>
          <li><strong>Teardrop Attack</strong>: A teardrop attack exploits a vulnerability
            in the way a target system reassembles fragmented IP packets. The attacker
            sends IP packets with overlapping fragments that the target system cannot
            properly reassemble. This can cause the system to crash or become unstable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Comparing DDoS with PDOS:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attac</strong>k: In a DDoS
            attack, multiple compromised computers, known as a botnet, are used to
            flood the target system or network with a massive volume of traffic. The
            distributed nature of the attack makes it difficult to mitigate as the
            traffic comes from multiple sources, making it harder to block or filter.</li>
          <li><strong>PDOS (Permanent Denial of Service) Attack</strong>: PDOS, also
            known as "bricking," aims to permanently disable a target system or device
            by exploiting vulnerabilities in its firmware or software. The attack renders
            the system or device inoperable, requiring physical repair or replacement.
            Unlike DDoS attacks, PDOS attacks focus on causing permanent damage rather
            than temporary disruption.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) What is SQL injection? How is it executed? How can we protect data from this attack?</h2>
        <p>SQL injection is a type of web application vulnerability where an attacker
          inserts malicious SQL code into a web application's input fields or parameters.
          The goal is to manipulate the application's database queries and gain unauthorized
          access to or control over the database.</p>
        <p>Execution of SQL Injection:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Malicious Input</strong>: The attacker identifies a vulnerable
            input field or parameter in a web application, such as a login form or
            search box.</li>
          <li><strong>SQL Code Injection</strong>: The attacker inserts malicious SQL
            code into the input field, taking advantage of improper input validation
            or lack of parameterization in the application's code.</li>
          <li><strong>Database Manipulation</strong>: When the application processes
            the input, the malicious SQL code is executed by the database server. This
            can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even the execution
            of arbitrary commands on the database server.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Protecting Data from SQL Injection:</p>
        <p>To protect data from SQL injection attacks, consider the following measures:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Implement strict input validation and
            sanitization techniques to ensure that user-supplied data is properly validated
            and does not contain any malicious code.</li>
          <li><strong>Parameterized Queries</strong>: Use parameterized queries or prepared
            statements in your application's code. This helps separate the SQL code
            from the user-supplied data, preventing the injection of malicious code.</li>
          <li><strong>Least Privilege Principle</strong>: Ensure that the database user
            account used by the application has the least privileges necessary to perform
            its tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause if a
            SQL injection vulnerability is exploited.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Updates and Patching</strong>: Keep your web application
            and database management system up to date with the latest security patches
            and updates. This helps protect against known vulnerabilities that attackers
            may exploit.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong>: Implement a WAF that
            can detect and block SQL injection attempts. A WAF can analyze incoming
            requests and filter out malicious SQL code before it reaches the application.</li>
