      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) How can we classify cybercrimes? Identify any five cybercrimes against organization. Elaborate each with suitable example State the difference between passive and active attacks. Provide examples.</h2>
        <p>Cybercrimes can be classified into various categories based on the nature
          of the offense</p>
        <h6><strong>1. Cybercrime against individual</strong>:&nbsp;</h6>
        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
          <li>E-Mail Spoofing and Other Online Fraud</li>
          <li>Phishing</li>
          <li>Spamming</li>
          <li>Cyberdefamation</li>
          <li>Cyberstalking and Harassment</li>
          <li>Computer Sabotage</li>
        </ol>
        <h6><strong>2. Cybercrime against property</strong>:</h6>
        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
          <li>Credit Card Frauds</li>
          <li>Intellectual Property Crime</li>
          <li>Internet Time Theft</li>
        </ol>
        <h6><strong>3. Cybercrime against organization</strong>:&nbsp;</h6>
        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
          <li>Unauthorized Accessing of Computer</li>
          <li>Password Sniffing</li>
          <li>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks</li>
          <li>Virus</li>
          <li>E-Mail Bombing</li>

          <li>Data Diddling</li>
          <li>Industrial Spying</li>
          <li>Computer Network Intrusions</li>
          <li>Software Piracy</li>
        </ol>
        <h6><strong>4. Cybercrime against society</strong>:&nbsp;</h6>
        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
          <li>Forgery</li>
          <li>Cyberterrorism</li>
          <li>Web Jacking</li>
        </ol>
        <h6><strong>5. Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroup</strong>:&nbsp;</h6>
        <p>Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroups refer to illegal activities that
          are conducted through Usenet, a decentralized network of discussion forums
          and message boards. While Usenet itself is a legitimate platform for exchanging
          information and engaging in discussions, it can also be misused for criminal
          purposes. Here are some examples of crimes that can occur on Usenet:</p>
        <h6><strong>Passive attacks and active attacks are two different types of cyber attacks:</strong></h6>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Passive Attacks</strong>: In a passive attack, the attacker intercepts
            and monitors data without altering it. The goal is to gather information
            covertly. For example, eavesdropping on network traffic to capture sensitive
            data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, without the knowledge of
            the users involved.</li>
          <li><strong>Active Attacks</strong>: Active attacks involve unauthorized modification
            or destruction of data, or disruption of network services. Unlike passive
            attacks, active attacks directly affect the integrity or availability of
            the targeted system. For instance, a hacker might inject malicious code
            into a website to deface it or launch a denial-of-service attack to make
            a website inaccessible.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) Elaborate Bluetooth hacking. Discuss four common attacks that have emerged in hacking Bluetooth.</h2>
        <p>Bluetooth hacking refers to unauthorized access or manipulation of Bluetooth-enabled
          devices. Here are four common attacks that have emerged in Bluetooth hacking:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Bluejacking</strong>: Bluejacking involves sending unsolicited
            messages or business cards to Bluetooth-enabled devices within range. The
            attacker exploits the device's Bluetooth feature to send messages without
            pairing or gaining access to the target device. This attack is usually
            harmless and used for pranks or advertising purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Bluesnarfing</strong>: Bluesnarfing is a more serious attack where
            an attacker gains unauthorized access to a Bluetooth-enabled device to
            steal or manipulate data. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
            protocol, the attacker can access contacts, messages, emails, or other
            sensitive information stored on the device.</li>
          <li><strong>Bluebugging</strong>: Bluebugging is an advanced attack that allows
            an attacker to take control of a Bluetooth-enabled device. Once compromised,
            the attacker can make calls, send messages, access data, or even use the
            device as a listening device without the user's knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS)</strong>: Bluetooth DoS attacks aim to
            disrupt the normal functioning of Bluetooth devices or networks. By flooding
            the target device or network with excessive connection requests or malicious
            data, the attacker can render the Bluetooth service unavailable, causing
            inconvenience or financial losses.</li>
