        <h2>(a) State the difference between passive and active attacks? What is Cryptographically &nbsp;generated address? How do they enhance the security</h2>
        <p>The difference between passive and active attacks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Passive Attacks</strong>: In a passive attack, the attacker intercepts
            and monitors data without altering it. The goal is to gather information
            covertly. Passive attacks include activities like eavesdropping on network
            traffic, capturing sensitive data, or monitoring communication patterns.
            The attacker does not actively disrupt or modify the targeted system or
            data.</li>
          <li><strong>Active Attacks</strong>: In an active attack, the attacker actively
            modifies or disrupts data or systems. The goal is to directly affect the
            integrity or availability of the targeted system. Active attacks involve
            actions such as injecting malicious code, altering data, launching denial-of-service
            attacks, or gaining unauthorized access to systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A <strong>cryptographically generated address (CGA)</strong> is an address
          generated using cryptographic techniques. It is commonly used in network
          protocols, such as IPv6, to enhance security. CGAs provide a way to verify
          the authenticity and integrity of network addresses.</p>
        <p>CGAs enhance security in the following ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Address Ownership Verification</strong>: CGAs use cryptographic
            algorithms to generate a unique address that can be linked to a specific
            entity. This helps verify the ownership of the address and prevents unauthorized
            use or spoofing.</li>
          <li><strong>Address Integrity</strong>: CGAs include a digital signature that
            ensures the integrity of the address. Any modification or tampering with
            the address can be detected through the verification of the digital signature.</li>
          <li><strong>Protection against Address Spoofing</strong>: CGAs make it difficult
            for attackers to impersonate legitimate addresses. The cryptographic techniques
            used in CGAs make it computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers
            to generate valid addresses.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) What is social engineering? Explain any three examples each of human based and computer based social engineering.</h2>
        <p>Social engineering refers to the manipulation of individuals to gain unauthorized
          access to information or systems. It exploits human psychology, trust,
          and vulnerabilities to deceive people into revealing sensitive information
          or performing actions that benefit the attacker.</p>
        <p>Three examples of human-based social engineering:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Pretexting</strong>: In pretexting, the attacker creates a fictional
            scenario or pretext to trick individuals into disclosing sensitive information.
            For example, an attacker might pose as a bank representative and call a
            person, claiming there is an issue with their account and requesting their
            login credentials.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: Phishing is a common form of social engineering
            where attackers send deceptive emails or messages that appear to be from
            a legitimate source. The messages often contain links to fake websites
            that trick users into entering their personal information, such as passwords
            or credit card details.</li>
          <li><strong>Tailgating</strong>: Tailgating involves an attacker following
            an authorized person into a restricted area by pretending to be an employee
            or someone with legitimate access. The attacker takes advantage of the
            person's politeness or lack of suspicion to gain physical access to secure
            areas.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Three examples of computer-based social engineering:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Malware Attacks</strong>: Attackers use various techniques, such
            as email attachments or malicious downloads, to trick users into installing
            malware on their computers. The malware can then be used to steal sensitive
            information or gain unauthorized access to systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Baiting</strong>: Baiting involves enticing users with an offer
            or reward, such as a free software download or a USB drive left in a public
            place. Once the user interacts with the bait, malware is installed on their
            system, allowing the attacker to gain access or control.</li>
          <li><strong>Pharming</strong>: Pharming is a technique where attackers redirect
            users to fake websites by manipulating the DNS (Domain Name System) settings
            or compromising routers. Users unknowingly enter their login credentials
            or sensitive information on these fake websites, which are then captured
            by the attacker.</li>
        </ol>
