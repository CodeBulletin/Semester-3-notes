      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) Discuss the challenges in Computer Forensics. Discuss role of forensics on social networking sites.</h2>
        <p>Challenges in Computer Forensics:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Encryption and Data Protection</strong>: The increasing use of
            encryption techniques and data protection measures poses a significant
            challenge for computer forensics. Encrypted data may be difficult or even
            impossible to access without the proper decryption keys, making it challenging
            to retrieve relevant evidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-Forensic Techniques</strong>: Perpetrators of cybercrimes
            are becoming more sophisticated in their use of anti-forensic techniques.
            These techniques aim to erase or hide digital evidence, making it difficult
            for investigators to recover and analyze data. Examples include file wiping,
            data obfuscation, and steganography.</li>
          <li><strong>Volatile Data</strong>: Volatile data refers to information that
            is stored in temporary memory and is lost when a computer is powered off
            or restarted. Capturing and preserving volatile data, such as running processes
            or network connections, can be challenging as it requires specialized tools
            and techniques.</li>
          <li><strong>Jurisdictional Issues</strong>: Computer forensics often involves
            investigations that span multiple jurisdictions, both nationally and internationally.
            Coordinating efforts, obtaining legal permissions, and navigating different
            legal frameworks can be complex and time-consuming.</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid Technological Advancements</strong>: The field of computer
            technology is constantly evolving, with new devices, operating systems,
            and software being introduced regularly. Computer forensics professionals
            need to stay updated with the latest technologies and techniques to effectively
            investigate and analyze digital evidence.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Role of Forensics on Social Networking Sites:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Digital Evidence Collection</strong>: Social networking sites
            generate a vast amount of digital evidence, including user profiles, posts,
            messages, photos, and videos. Computer forensics plays a crucial role in
            collecting and preserving this evidence for investigations related to cyberbullying,
            harassment, defamation, or other criminal activities.</li>
          <li><strong>User Identification and Verification</strong>: Social networking
            sites often require users to create accounts and provide personal information.
            Computer forensics can help in identifying and verifying the authenticity
            of user accounts, tracking IP addresses, and linking online activities
            to specific individuals.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Footprint Analysis</strong>: Social networking sites leave
            a digital footprint of users' activities, interactions, and connections.
            Computer forensics can analyze this digital footprint to reconstruct timelines,
            establish relationships, and gather evidence related to criminal activities,
            such as cyberstalking or online fraud.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberbullying and Harassment Investigations</strong>: Computer
            forensics can play a crucial role in investigating cases of cyberbullying
            and harassment on social networking sites. It can help in identifying the
            perpetrators, collecting evidence of abusive behavior, and providing support
            for legal actions or interventions.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Recovery and Reconstruction</strong>: In cases where social
            networking accounts are deleted or data is intentionally erased, computer
            forensics can employ specialized techniques to recover deleted data or
            reconstruct digital trails. This can be valuable in uncovering evidence
            related to cybercrimes or online misconduct.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) Discuss the terms Intellectual Property rights, Trademarks, Domain name and Patents with suitable examples.</h2>
        <p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refer to legal rights that are granted
          to individuals or organizations for their creations or inventions. These
          rights provide exclusive ownership and control over the use and distribution
          of intellectual property. Here are explanations of some key terms related
          to IPR:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Trademarks</strong>: Trademarks are distinctive signs, symbols,
            logos, or names used to identify and distinguish goods or services of one
            company from those of others. They help consumers recognize and associate
            products or services with a particular brand. For example, the Nike "swoosh"
            logo is a registered trademark that represents the Nike brand.</li>
          <li><strong>Domain Name</strong>: A domain name is a unique address that identifies
            a website on the internet. It serves as a user-friendly way to access websites
            instead of using IP addresses. Domain names are registered and can be protected
            as intellectual property. For example, "google.com" is a domain name that
            represents the Google search engine.</li>
          <li><strong>Patents</strong>: Patents are exclusive rights granted to inventors
            for their inventions. They provide legal protection for new and useful
            inventions, preventing others from making, using, or selling the patented
            invention without permission. Patents can cover a wide range of inventions,
            including technological innovations, processes, or products. For example,
            the patent for the telephone was granted to Alexander Graham Bell.</li>
