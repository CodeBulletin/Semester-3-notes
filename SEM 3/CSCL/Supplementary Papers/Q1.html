       <h1>Q1</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) What is cyberterrorism? Compare cyber espionage and cyberwarfare</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cyberterrorism</strong> refers to the use of cyber attacks by individuals
            or groups to create fear, panic, or disruption for political, ideological,
            or religious purposes. It involves the deliberate targeting of critical
            infrastructure, government systems, or public networks to cause damage,
            disrupt services, or spread fear among the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyber espionage</strong>, on the other hand, involves unauthorized
            access to computer systems or networks to gather sensitive information
            for political, economic, or military purposes. It is often conducted by
            nation-states or state-sponsored actors to gain an advantage in areas such
            as intelligence, defense, or economic competition.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberwarfare</strong> refers to the use of cyber attacks as a means
            of waging war or conducting military operations. It involves the use of
            cyber weapons and tactics to disrupt or disable enemy systems, gather intelligence,
            or launch offensive operations. Unlike cyberterrorism, cyberwarfare is
            typically conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored entities in the
            context of armed conflicts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While cyberterrorism, cyber espionage, and cyberwarfare share some similarities
          in terms of using cyber attacks, their motivations, targets, and objectives
          differ significantly..</p>
        <h2>(b) Who are cybercriminals? Categorize different types of cybercriminals with suitable example for each category.</h2>
        <p>Cybercriminals are individuals or groups who engage in illegal activities
          using computer networks or the internet. They exploit vulnerabilities,
          launch attacks, and commit various types of cybercrimes for financial gain,
          personal motives, or malicious intent. Here are some categories of cybercriminals:</p>
        <p><strong>Type I: Cybercriminals </strong>- hungry for recognition&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hobby hackers&nbsp;</li>
          <li>IT professionals&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Politically motivated hackers&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Terrorist organizations&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Type II: Cybercriminals </strong>- not interested in recognition&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Psychological perverts&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Financially motivated hackers&nbsp;</li>
          <li>State-sponsored hacking&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Organized criminals</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Type III: cybercriminals</strong> - the insiders&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Former employees seeking revenge&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Competing companies using employees to gain economic advantage through
            damage and/or theft</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(c) Contrast spam with spoofing. Enlist two methods to control spamming.</h2>
        <p>Spam refers to unsolicited and unwanted bulk emails sent to a large number
          of recipients, typically for advertising or fraudulent purposes. Spoofing,
          on the other hand, is a technique used to falsify the source of an email
          or network communication to make it appear as if it is coming from a different
          sender or source.</p>
        <p>Contrast between spam and spoofing:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Spam</strong>: Spam emails are unwanted and unsolicited messages
            sent in bulk to a large number of recipients. They often contain advertisements,
            scams, or malicious content. The primary goal of spam is to reach as many
            recipients as possible, often without their consent, to promote products,
            services, or fraudulent schemes.</li>
          <li><strong>Spoofing</strong>: Spoofing involves manipulating the source information
            of an email or network communication to make it appear as if it is coming
            from a different sender or source. This can include falsifying the sender's
            email address, IP address, or other identifying information. Spoofing can
            be used for various purposes, such as phishing attacks, email scams, or
            hiding the true origin of an attack.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Methods to control spamming:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Email Filters</strong>: Implementing email filters or spam filters
            can help automatically detect and block spam emails based on predefined
            rules, patterns, or blacklists. These filters analyze various aspects of
            the email, such as sender information, content, and attachments, to determine
            if it is spam.</li>
          <li><strong>User Education and Awareness</strong>: Educating users about safe
            email practices, recognizing spam emails, and avoiding clicking on suspicious
            links or downloading attachments from unknown sources can help reduce the
            risk of falling victim to spam or phishing attacks.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(d) Compare ethical hackers with crackers. List any 3 rules to be abided by the ethical hackers.</h2>
        <p>Ethical hackers, also known as white hat hackers or security researchers,
          are individuals who use their technical skills and knowledge to identify
          vulnerabilities and weaknesses in computer systems, networks, or applications.
          Their goal is to help organizations improve their security by identifying
          and fixing potential vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit
          them.</p>
        <p>Crackers, on the other hand, are individuals who engage in hacking activities
          with malicious intent. They exploit vulnerabilities, gain unauthorized
          access, steal data, or cause damage to computer systems or networks.</p>
        <p>Comparison between ethical hackers and crackers:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intent</strong>: Ethical hackers have a legitimate and lawful
            intent to identify and fix vulnerabilities, whereas crackers have malicious
            intent to exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain or to cause harm.</li>
          <li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Ethical hackers perform their activities
            with proper authorization from the system owners, whereas crackers engage
            in unauthorized activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: Ethical hackers adhere to a code of ethics, which
            includes respecting privacy, confidentiality, and legal boundaries. Crackers
            disregard ethical considerations and engage in illegal activities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Three rules to be abided by ethical hackers:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Obtain Proper Authorization</strong>: Ethical hackers should always
            obtain written permission from the system owner or authorized personnel
            before conducting any security testing or vulnerability assessments.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain Confidentiality</strong>: Ethical hackers must respect
            the confidentiality of any sensitive information they come across during
            their assessments. They should not disclose or misuse any confidential
            data they encounter.</li>
          <li><strong>Report Findings Responsibly</strong>: Ethical hackers should report
            their findings and vulnerabilities to the system owner or appropriate authorities
            promptly and responsibly. They should provide clear and detailed information
            to help the organization address and fix the identified vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(e) What is role of polymorphic generators in polymorphic virus?</h2>
        <p>Polymorphic generators play a crucial role in polymorphic viruses. Polymorphic
          viruses are a type of malware that can change their code or appearance
          each time they replicate, making it difficult for traditional antivirus
          software to detect and block them.</p>
        <p>Polymorphic generators are algorithms or routines within the virus code
          that are responsible for generating new, unique variants of the virus.
          These generators use various techniques, such as encryption, obfuscation,
          or code mutation, to create different versions of the virus with each replication.
          By constantly changing their code, polymorphic viruses can evade signature-based
          detection methods used by antivirus software.</p>
        <p>The role of polymorphic generators is to ensure that each new variant
          of the virus is sufficiently different from previous versions, making it
          challenging for antivirus software to recognize and block them. This allows
          the polymorphic virus to continue spreading and infecting systems without
          being easily detected.</p>
        <h2>(f) Justify botnets can be used as a fuel in cybercrime.</h2>
        <p>Botnets, which are networks of compromised computers controlled by a central
          command-and-control (C&amp;C) server, can be used as a fuel in cybercrime
          due to their capabilities and characteristics. Here are some justifications:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</strong>: Botnets
            can be used to launch large-scale DDoS attacks, where multiple compromised
            computers simultaneously flood a target system or network with a massive
            amount of traffic, causing it to become overwhelmed and unavailable to
            legitimate users. Cybercriminals can rent or utilize botnets to extort
            money from targeted organizations or disrupt their operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Spam Distribution</strong>: Botnets can be utilized to distribute
            spam emails on a massive scale. By leveraging the computational power and
            network bandwidth of the compromised computers, cybercriminals can send
            out a high volume of spam messages, promoting various scams, phishing attempts,
            or malware distribution.</li>
          <li><strong>Credential Theft and Fraud</strong>: Botnets can be used to steal
            sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data, from
            compromised computers. This stolen information can be used for identity
            theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to online accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Malware Distribution</strong>: Botnets can serve as a distribution
            platform for malware. Cybercriminals can use the compromised computers
            to host and distribute malicious software, such as ransomware, spyware,
            or banking trojans, to infect more systems and expand their criminal operations.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(g) Elaborate steganography. Contrast steganography with cryptography.</h2>
        <p>Steganography is the practice of concealing secret or sensitive information
          within seemingly innocuous or unrelated data or media, such as images,
          audio files, or documents. It involves embedding the hidden information
          in a way that is not easily detectable by casual observers.</p>
        <p>Contrast between steganography and cryptography:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Steganography</strong>: Steganography focuses on hiding the existence
            of the secret information by embedding it within other data. The goal is
            to make the presence of the hidden information undetectable. Steganography
            does not necessarily involve encryption or altering the original data.</li>
          <li><strong>Cryptography</strong>: Cryptography involves transforming the
            original data or information using mathematical algorithms to make it unintelligible
            to unauthorized individuals. The goal of cryptography is to ensure the
            confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data. Cryptographic
            techniques often involve encryption and decryption processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While both steganography and cryptography aim to protect sensitive information,
          they differ in their approach. Steganography focuses on hiding the information,
          while cryptography focuses on transforming the information to make it secure.</p>
        <h2>(h) How do we realize that our system is infected by malware?</h2>
        <p>Indications that a system may be infected by malware can vary depending
          on the specific malware and its behavior. However, some common signs that
          may indicate a malware infection include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Slow Performance</strong>: If your system suddenly becomes significantly
            slower than usual, it could be a sign of malware activity. Malware can
            consume system resources, causing sluggishness and delays in normal operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Unexpected Pop-ups or Advertisements</strong>: If you start seeing
            an excessive number of pop-up windows or intrusive advertisements, especially
            when you are not browsing the internet, it could indicate the presence
            of adware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).</li>
          <li><strong>Unusual Network Activity</strong>: If your network activity is
            unusually high, even when you are not actively using the internet, it could
            be a sign of malware. Malware may communicate with remote servers or participate
            in botnet activities, leading to increased network traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Unauthorized System Changes</strong>: If you notice unauthorized
            changes to your system settings, such as new browser toolbars, unfamiliar
            icons, or modified browser homepage, it could indicate the presence of
            malware that has altered your system configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>Disabled Security Software</strong>: If your antivirus or security
            software suddenly becomes disabled or stops functioning properly without
            any action from your side, it could be a sign of malware attempting to
            evade detection.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(i) What is cryptographically generated address? How do they enhance the security?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>A cryptographically generated address (CGA) is an IPv6 address that is
          generated using cryptographic techniques to enhance its security and authenticity.
          CGAs are used to verify the identity of a device or host in an IPv6 network.</p>
        <p>CGAs are created by combining the device's public key with other parameters,
          such as the device's IPv6 address and a nonce. This combination is then
          hashed to generate a unique CGA. The resulting CGA serves as a digital
          signature that can be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of
          the device's communication in the network.</p>
        <p>CGAs enhance security by providing a means to verify that the device claiming
          a particular IPv6 address is the legitimate owner of that address. This
          helps prevent address spoofing or unauthorized use of IP addresses in the
          network. By using CGAs, network administrators can have increased confidence
          in the identity and trustworthiness of devices communicating over IPv6.</p>
        <h2>(j) Compare and contrast trade name and trade secret.</h2>
        <p>Trade Name: A trade name, also known as a business name or a company name,
          is the name under which a business operates or conducts its commercial
          activities. It is used to identify and distinguish a business from others
          in the marketplace. A trade name is protected under trademark law and provides
          exclusive rights to the business to use that name in its specific industry
          or geographic region.</p>
        <p>Example: Coca-Cola is a well-known trade name that identifies the brand
          and products of The Coca-Cola Company.</p>
        <p>Trade Secret: A trade secret refers to confidential and valuable business
          information that provides a competitive advantage to a company. It can
          include formulas, processes, customer lists, marketing strategies, or any
          other confidential information that is not generally known or easily accessible
          to others. Unlike patents or trademarks, trade secrets are not publicly
          registered or disclosed. Instead, they are protected through confidentiality
          agreements, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements.</p>
        <p>Example: The secret recipe of Coca-Cola is a famous trade secret that
          has been closely guarded by The Coca-Cola Company for decades.</p>
        <p>While trade names focus on the identification and branding of a business,
          trade secrets protect valuable confidential information that gives a competitive
          edge to a company.</p>
