       <h1>Cybercrime and Cyber Security</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cybercrime</strong> refers to criminal activities carried out by
          means of computers or the internet. This broad category includes a variety
          of crimes, such as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identity Theft</strong>: Stealing personal information to impersonate
            someone else.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: Sending fraudulent emails or messages that
            mimic legitimate sources to trick individuals into revealing personal information.</li>
          <li><strong>Hacking</strong>: Unauthorized access to computer systems for
            stealing data, causing disruptions, or other malicious purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Ransomware Attacks</strong>: Infecting a computer with malware
            that encrypts data, demanding payment for its release.</li>
          <li><strong>Online Fraud</strong>: Deceptive practices for financial gain,
            such as online auction fraud, credit card fraud, and investment scams.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberstalking and Harassment</strong>: Using the internet to stalk
            or harass individuals.</li>
          <li><strong>Spreading Malware</strong>: Distributing harmful software such
            as viruses, worms, and trojans.</li>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Property Theft</strong>: Piracy and illegal downloading
            of copyrighted material.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, on the other hand, involves protecting
          computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access, damage,
          or attack. It encompasses a range of practices, technologies, and processes
          designed to safeguard the cyber environment and user data. Key aspects
          of cybersecurity include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Network Security</strong>: Protecting network infrastructure and
            securing data from unauthorized access and attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Information Security</strong>: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity,
            and availability of data.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Security</strong>: Securing software and applications
            against threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Endpoint Security</strong>: Protecting devices like computers
            and mobile devices from malicious threats.</li>
          <li><strong>Identity Management</strong>: Ensuring that only authorized individuals
            can access specific information and resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Database and Infrastructure Security</strong>: Safeguarding databases
            and physical infrastructure from attacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud Security</strong>: Protecting data and applications hosted
            in cloud environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity Planning</strong>: Preparing
            for and recovering from cybersecurity incidents to maintain business operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Education and Training</strong>: Educating employees and users
            about safe computing practices and potential threats.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The balance between cybercrime and cybersecurity is a constant challenge,
          with new threats emerging as technology evolves. Cybersecurity is essential
          in today's digital world to protect personal information, sensitive business
          data, and critical national infrastructure.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span style="background-color:rgb(52,53,65);color:rgb(209,213,219);">Cybercrime, in its narrow sense (computer crime), refers to illegal activities specifically targeting computer systems' security and their data using electronic methods. This is a more restrictive definition. In a broader sense (computer-related crime), it encompasses any illegal behavior committed using or related to computer systems or networks, including crimes like illegal possession and distribution of information through these systems. This represents a wider understanding of cybercrime.</span>
