        <ol>
          <li><strong>Data Protection and Privacy</strong>: Laws controlling personal
            data use, ensuring privacy rights, and requiring consent for data processing.

          <li><strong>Cybercrime Legislation</strong>: Laws criminalizing online activities
            like hacking, identity theft, and unauthorized system access, underpinning
            legal actions against cybercriminals.</li>
