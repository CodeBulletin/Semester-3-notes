       <h1>Intellectual Property Rights</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are legal rights that provide creators
          protection for their inventions, designs, and original works. These rights
          are critical in fostering innovation and creativity, providing a way for
          inventors and creators to benefit from their work. The main types of IPR
          include:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Copyright</strong>: Protects original works of authorship, such
          as books, music, film, and software. Copyright gives the creator exclusive
          rights to use their work and allows them to control how it is distributed
          and reproduced.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Patents</strong>: Grant inventors exclusive rights to their inventions.
          They prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention without
          permission for a certain period, usually 20 years.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Trademarks</strong>: Protect symbols, names, and slogans used
          to identify goods and services. The aim is to distinguish one brand from
          another and prevent confusion in the marketplace.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Trade Secrets</strong>: Involve business practices, designs, formulas,
          recipes, or processes that are confidential and provide a competitive edge.
          Protection of trade secrets prevents others from using this information
          if it is obtained through dishonest means.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Industrial Design Rights</strong>: Protect the visual design of
          objects that are not purely utilitarian. An industrial design consists
          of the creation of a shape, configuration, or composition of pattern or
          color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing
          aesthetic value.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Geographical Indications</strong>: Are signs used on products
          that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation
          due to that origin.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">IPR is crucial for economic growth, stimulating innovation, and safeguarding
          the unique work of creators, thereby contributing to cultural diversity
          and technological advancement. Different countries have varying laws and
          systems for protecting intellectual property, and international agreements
          such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
          Rights (TRIPS) help standardize these protections globally.</p>
