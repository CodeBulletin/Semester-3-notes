       <h1>Authorship</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Authorship, crucial in intellectual property rights, denotes creating
          an original work and being recognized as its creator, impacting copyright
          ownership.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key Points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Creation of Original Work</strong>: Involves producing unique
            works like books, songs, paintings, software, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Recognition and Rights</strong>: The author, typically the work's
            creator, holds copyright, granting exclusive usage and distribution rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Moral Rights</strong>: Include the right to attribution and to
            object to work distortions harming the author's reputation.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaborative Works</strong>: Authorship can be complex, potentially
            involving joint authors based on individual contributions.</li>
          <li><strong>Employment and Commissioned Works</strong>: Employers or commissioners
            might own works created by employees or through commission.</li>
          <li><strong>Anonymous/Pseudonymous Works</strong>: Have different copyright
            treatment, with variations in protection duration.</li>
          <li><strong>Variations in Literary/Artistic Works</strong>: Differences in
            moral rights application between literary and artistic works.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Age Challenges</strong>: Determining authorship in digital
            media, like software and AI-generated content, can be complex.</li>
          <li><strong>Plagiarism and Infringement</strong>: Unauthorized use of another's
            work, closely related to authorship.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Authorship is key in copyright law for protecting creators' rights, fostering
          creativity, and innovation.</p>
