       <h1>Authorship</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Authorship refers to the act of creating an original work and being recognized
          as the creator of that work. This concept is especially important in the
          context of intellectual property rights, as it determines who holds the
          copyright and associated legal rights. Key aspects of authorship include:</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Creation of Original Work</strong>: Authorship involves creating
          a work that is original and not copied from other sources. This can include
          writing a book, composing a song, creating a painting, developing software,
          or any other form of creative expression.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Recognition and Rights</strong>: The author is typically the person
            who has created the work and is legally recognized as its originator. As
            the author, this individual usually holds the copyright to the work, granting
            them exclusive rights to use, distribute, and authorize others to use the
            work.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Moral Rights</strong>: In many jurisdictions, authors have moral
            rights in addition to economic rights. These include the right to be credited
            as the author (right of attribution) and the right to object to any distortion
            or mutilation of their work that could harm their reputation (right of
            integrity).</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Collaborative Works</strong>: Authorship can be more complex in
            collaborative works, where multiple individuals contribute. Determining
            authorship in such cases depends on the nature of the contribution of each
            individual. In some cases, all contributors might be considered joint authors.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Employment and Commissioned Works</strong>: For works created
            by an employee as part of their job, or works commissioned by someone else,
            the employer or the person who commissioned the work might be considered
            the legal author, depending on the agreement and local laws.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Anonymous and Pseudonymous Works</strong>: If a work is published
              anonymously or under a pseudonym, the authorship may be treated differently
              for copyright purposes. The duration of copyright protection, for instance,
              can be calculated differently.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Literary vs. Artistic Authorship</strong>: The concept of authorship
              varies slightly between literary works (like books and articles) and artistic
              works (like paintings and sculptures), particularly in how moral rights
              are applied and enforced.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Issues in the Digital Age</strong>: With the rise of digital media
              and technology, determining authorship can be challenging, especially with
              works like software, digital art, and content created using AI tools.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Plagiarism and Infringement</strong>: Issues of plagiarism (using
              someone else's work without attribution) and copyright infringement are
              closely tied to the concept of authorship, as they involve unauthorized
              use of a work created by another person.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Overall, authorship is a fundamental concept in copyright law and is essential
                for protecting the rights and interests of creators, while also fostering
                creativity and innovation.</p>
