       <h1>Copyrights</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Copyright is a form of intellectual property law that protects original
          works of authorship. This legal concept is designed to encourage creativity
          and innovation by giving creators exclusive rights to their works for a
          certain period of time. Here are the key aspects of copyrights:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Nature of Protection</strong>: Copyright law grants the creator
          of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution. This
          includes the right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, or license
          the work.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Types of Works Protected</strong>: Copyright protects a wide range
          of creative works, including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic
          works. This encompasses books, music, movies, sculptures, paintings, software,
          and even architecture.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Originality Requirement</strong>: To be eligible for copyright
          protection, a work must be original and possess some degree of creativity.
          It does not protect ideas, facts, or methods of operation; however, it
          may protect the way these are expressed.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Duration of Protection</strong>: The duration of copyright varies
          by jurisdiction, but it typically lasts for the lifetime of the author
          plus a certain number of years (often 50 to 70 years). After this period,
          the work usually enters the public domain, meaning it can be used freely
          by anyone.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Registration and Formalities</strong>: In many countries, copyright
          protection is automatic upon the creation of the work and does not require
          formal registration. However, registering a copyright can provide additional
          legal benefits, such as the ability to bring a lawsuit for infringement
          in federal court.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Fair Use Doctrine</strong>: Copyright law often includes a "fair
          use" provision, which allows limited use of copyrighted material without
          permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
          scholarship, or research.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>International Protection</strong>: Copyright protection is generally
          governed by national laws. However, international treaties, such as the
          Berne Convention, provide a framework for recognizing copyrights across
          member countries.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Copyright law aims to balance the interests of creators in protecting
          and profiting from their work with the public interest in the free flow
          of information, cultural access, and the fostering of further creative
          innovation.</p>
