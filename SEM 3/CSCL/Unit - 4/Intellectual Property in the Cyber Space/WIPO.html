        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a specialized agency
          of the United Nations focused on intellectual property (IP) rights. It
          plays a key role in the global administration of IP rights and serves as
          a forum for international cooperation on IP matters. Here are some key
          aspects of WIPO:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Foundation and Purpose</strong>: WIPO was established in 1967
          with the signing of the WIPO Convention. Its primary goal is to encourage
          creative activity and to promote the protection of intellectual property
          worldwide.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Membership</strong>: WIPO has 193 member states, making it a truly
          global organization. It works with governments, non-governmental organizations,
          and individuals to develop and enforce international IP laws.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Functions and Activities</strong>: WIPO administers various international
          treaties related to IP, offers services for the international registration
          of trademarks, patents, and designs, provides dispute resolution services,
          and assists in the development of IP laws and policies.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>International Treaties and Agreements</strong>: WIPO oversees
          several key international treaties on IP, including the Berne Convention
          for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Paris Convention
          for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Patent Cooperation Treaty.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Support for Developing Countries</strong>: WIPO plays a crucial
          role in helping developing countries access and use IP for economic, social,
          and cultural development. This includes technical assistance and capacity-building
          programs.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Global Databases and Information Services</strong>: WIPO maintains
            several databases that provide free access to IP information, such as patent
            and trademark data. These resources are vital for researchers, entrepreneurs,
            and policymakers.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Policy and Legal Framework Development</strong>: The organization
            works on developing international IP laws and policies, aiming to create
            a balanced and effective international IP system.</p>

            to raise awareness about the importance and benefits of IP, including educational
            programs and resources.</p>

            of creators and the public, and ensuring that the IP system contributes
