       <h1>Q3</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) What is spamming? Compare and contrast spamming with search engine spamming Enlist any three techniques cyber-criminals use in search engine spamming</h2>
        <h4>What is Spamming?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Spamming refers to the practice of sending
            unsolicited messages, especially advertising messages, to a large number
            of users. This is often done via email, but can also occur in other digital
            communication forms like instant messaging, social media, and web forums.</li>
          <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The primary goal is usually to advertise products
            or services, but it can also involve phishing attempts, spreading malware,
            or simply flooding users with unwanted content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Search Engine Spamming</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Search engine spamming, also known as spamdexing,
            involves manipulating search engine algorithms to gain an unfair advantage
            in the search engine results pages (SERPs).</li>
          <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The main goal is to increase the visibility
            of certain websites or web pages, often for commercial gain or to spread
            malicious content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Comparison and Contrast</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Similarity</strong>: Both practices involve the distribution of
            unwanted or unsolicited content.</li>
          <li><strong>Difference in Medium</strong>: Spamming is typically direct-to-user
            via emails or messages, while search engine spamming targets search engine
            mechanisms.</li>
          <li><strong>Difference in Intent</strong>: Regular spamming aims at the users
            directly for immediate response or action, whereas search engine spamming
            is more about long-term visibility and traffic redirection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Techniques in Search Engine Spamming</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Keyword Stuffing</strong>: Overloading web pages with keywords
            to manipulate a site's ranking.</li>
          <li><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Showing different content to search engines
            than to users, to improve rankings for certain queries.</li>
          <li><strong>Link Farms</strong>: Creating networks of websites that link to
            each other to artificially increase a site's link popularity and ranking.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) Elaborate cryptographically generated address. How are they used in securing mobile devices</h2>
        <h4>What are CGAs?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Cryptographically Generated Addresses are
            a type of IP address where the address itself is generated by using cryptographic
            methods, often involving a public key.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage</strong>: They are primarily used in securing communications
            over IPv6 networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>CGAs in Securing Mobile Devices</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: CGAs provide a higher level of security
            in network communications, particularly in environments like mobile IPv6.</li>
          <li><strong>Identity Verification</strong>: They ensure that the IP address
            of a device is tied to a cryptographic key, which helps in authenticating
            the device and protecting against certain types of attacks, such as spoofing.</li>
          <li><strong>Seamless Mobility</strong>: In mobile networking, CGAs can be
            used to securely maintain a device's identity and connections as it moves
            across different networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(c) List and explain any three popular attacks on mobile phone.</h2>
        <h4>1. Phishing Attacks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Description</strong>: Phishing involves tricking users into revealing
            personal or sensitive information. In mobile phones, this often happens
            through fraudulent emails, messages, or malicious apps.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact</strong>: Can lead to identity theft, financial loss, or
            unauthorized access to personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Malware Attacks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Description</strong>: Malicious software, including viruses, worms,
            and trojans, can be installed on mobile phones, often through malicious
            apps or compromised websites.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact</strong>: Malware can steal information, monitor user activities,
            or damage the device's functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Description</strong>: An attacker intercepts the communication
            between the mobile user and a service, such as through unsecured Wi-Fi
            networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact</strong>: The attacker can eavesdrop, steal data, and even
            alter the communication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these attacks poses significant risks to mobile phone users, highlighting
          the importance of maintaining strong security practices, such as regular
          software updates, cautious downloading of apps, and awareness of phishing
          techniques.</p>
