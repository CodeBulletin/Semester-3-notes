       <h1>Q2</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) Explain what Botnets are and how they are used in cybercriminal activities. Discuss the challenges posed by Botnets and potential strategies to counter them.</h2>
        <h4>What are Botnets?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: A botnet is a network of devices, often numbering
            in the thousands or millions, that are infected with malware and controlled
            remotely by a cybercriminal, known as a botmaster. These devices, called
            "bots," can include computers, servers, and even IoT (Internet of Things)
            devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Function</strong>: Botnets are used to perform a variety of malicious
            activities without the knowledge of the device owners.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Use in Cybercriminal Activities</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>DDoS Attacks</strong>: Botnets are often used for Distributed
            Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where a multitude of compromised devices
            flood a target server with traffic, overwhelming it and causing disruptions
            or shutdowns.</li>
          <li><strong>Spam and Phishing</strong>: They are utilized to send out massive
            volumes of spam emails, often used for phishing attempts to steal personal
            information.</li>
          <li><strong>Cryptojacking</strong>: Some botnets hijack the processing power
            of infected devices to mine cryptocurrencies.</li>
          <li><strong>Information Theft</strong>: Botnets can be used to harvest sensitive
            information from infected devices, including passwords, financial data,
            and personal information.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Challenges Posed by Botnets</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Scale and Distribution</strong>: Due to their large scale and
            the wide distribution of infected devices, botnets are difficult to dismantle.</li>
          <li><strong>Evolution and Sophistication</strong>: Botnets are constantly
            evolving, becoming more sophisticated in evading detection and countermeasures.</li>
          <li><strong>International Jurisdiction Issues</strong>: The global nature
            of botnets, with servers and infected devices spread across different countries,
            creates legal and logistical challenges in counteracting them.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Potential Strategies to Counter Botnets</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Detection</strong>: Developing advanced tools for the
            early detection of botnet activities.</li>
          <li><strong>International Collaboration</strong>: Strengthening international
            cooperation among law enforcement and cybersecurity organizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Public Awareness</strong>: Educating the public about safe internet
            practices to prevent their devices from becoming part of a botnet.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Software Updates</strong>: Encouraging regular updates
            of software and security systems to patch vulnerabilities that could be
            exploited by botmasters.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) State the difference between passive and active attacks. Provide examples.</h2>
        <h4>Passive Attacks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: A passive attack involves monitoring and
            eavesdropping on a network to gather information without affecting the
            system's resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Traffic Analysis</strong>: Monitoring unencrypted network traffic
                to gather valuable data.</li>
              <li><strong>Eavesdropping</strong>: Listening to private communications, such
                as email exchanges or instant messaging conversations.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Active Attacks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: An active attack attempts to alter system
            resources or affect their operation, thereby disrupting the integrity,
            availability, or confidentiality of information.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>DDoS Attacks</strong>: Flooding a server with traffic to disrupt
                service.</li>
              <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack</strong>: Intercepting and altering
                communication between two parties without their knowledge.</li>
              <li><strong>SQL Injection</strong>: Injecting malicious code into a database
                to manipulate or steal data.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(c) Elaborate 3 examples each of cyber-crime against property and cyber-crime against society.</h2>
        <h4><strong>1. Cybercrime against property</strong>:</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
          <li><strong>Credit Card Frauds</strong>: Credit card fraud refers to the unauthorized
            use of someone else's credit card information to make fraudulent transactions
            or obtain goods or services without the cardholder's consent. This can
            involve stealing physical credit cards, obtaining card details through
            phishing or hacking, or using counterfeit cards. Credit card fraud can
            result in financial losses for the cardholder and can also impact businesses
            and financial institutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Intellectual Property Crime</strong>: Intellectual property (IP)
            crime involves the infringement or unauthorized use of intellectual property
            rights, such as copyrights, trademarks, or patents. This can include activities
            like counterfeiting, piracy, or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted
            material, such as movies, music, software, or counterfeit products. IP
            crime not only causes financial losses to creators and rights holders but
            also undermines innovation, creativity, and fair competition.</li>
          <li><strong>Internet Time Theft</strong>: Internet time theft refers to the
            unauthorized use of an employer's internet resources or time for personal
            purposes during work hours. This can include activities like excessive
            personal internet browsing, accessing social media, or engaging in online
            shopping while on the job. Internet time theft can result in decreased
            productivity, wasted resources, and potential security risks for organizations.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><strong>2. Cybercrime against society</strong>:&nbsp;</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
          <li><strong>Forgery</strong>: Forgery refers to the act of creating or altering
            documents, objects, or information with the intent to deceive or defraud
            others. In the context of cybercrime, forgery can involve creating fake
            digital documents, such as counterfeit identification cards, passports,
            or financial records. It can also include forging digital signatures or
            manipulating electronic records to misrepresent information or gain unauthorized
            access to systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberterrorism</strong>: Cyberterrorism involves the use of cyber
            attacks by individuals or groups with political, ideological, or religious
            motivations to create fear, panic, or disruption on a large scale. Cyberterrorists
            may target critical infrastructure, government networks, or financial institutions
            with the aim of causing significant damage, disruption, or loss of life.
            Their actions can include hacking, spreading malware, launching denial-of-service
            attacks, or disseminating propaganda to further their political or ideological
            objectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Jacking</strong>: Web jacking, also known as website hijacking,
            refers to the unauthorized takeover or control of a website or web server
            by an attacker. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the website's
            security, gaining unauthorized access to the server, or manipulating the
            website's content or functionality. Web jacking can be done for various
            reasons, such as defacing the website, stealing sensitive information,
            or using the compromised website for malicious activities.</li>
