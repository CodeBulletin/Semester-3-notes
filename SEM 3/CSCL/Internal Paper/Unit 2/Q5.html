      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) What is SQL injection? How is it executed? How Can we protect data from this attack</h2>
        <h4>What is SQL Injection?</h4>
        <p>SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities
          in an application's software by injecting malicious SQL statements into
          an entry field for execution. This can allow attackers to access, modify,
          or delete data, or even gain administrative access to a database.</p>
        <h4>How is It Executed?</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Input Manipulation</strong>: Attackers input malicious SQL code
            into vulnerable input fields (like login forms) where inputs are not properly
            sanitized.</li>
          <li><strong>Exploiting Vulnerabilities</strong>: The application then passes
            this malicious input to the database, which executes the SQL command, compromising
            the database's security.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Protection Measures</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Ensure that all user inputs are validated
            for type, length, format, and range.</li>
          <li><strong>Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries</strong>: Use these
            in the application code to separate SQL code from data.</li>
          <li><strong>Stored Procedures</strong>: Employ stored procedures to encapsulate
            the SQL logic.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Security Audits</strong>: Regularly audit and test the
            applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Least Privilege</strong>: Assign the minimum necessary privileges
            to database accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Application Firewalls (WAF)</strong>: Use WAFs to detect and
            block SQL injection attacks.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(b) What are backdoors, and how do they have the potential to compromise the security and integrity of our system?</h2>
        <h4>What are Backdoors?</h4>
        <p>Backdoors are hidden entry points into a software, network, or system
          that bypass normal authentication and security mechanisms. They are often
          used for legitimate purposes, like providing system maintenance, but can
          be exploited for malicious activities.</p>
        <h4>Potential Compromises</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Unauthorized Access</strong>: Backdoors can allow attackers to
            gain unauthorized access to a system.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Theft and Manipulation</strong>: Once access is gained, data
            can be stolen, manipulated, or destroyed.</li>
          <li><strong>Surveillance</strong>: Attackers might use backdoors for continuous
            monitoring of activities on the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Spreading Malware</strong>: They can be used to spread malware
            within a network.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(c) Elaborate DoS aftack. Classify various DoS attacks and Explain Flood attack, ping of death and SYN attack.</h2>
        <h4>Elaboration on DoS Attack</h4>
        <p>DoS attacks aim to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its
          intended users, typically by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services
          of a host connected to the Internet.</p>
        <h4>Classification and Explanation</h4>
        <p><strong>Flood Attack</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanism: Overwhelming the target with excessive requests, making it
            impossible for the server to respond to legitimate traffic.</li>
          <li>Example: UDP flood attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ping of Death</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanism: Involves sending malformed or oversized packets using the ICMP
            protocol, causing systems to crash or reboot.</li>
          <li>Vulnerability: Older and unpatched systems are particularly susceptible
            to this attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>SYN Attack</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanism: The attacker sends a flood of SYN requests to the target's
            system in an attempt to overwhelm it, making it unable to respond to legitimate
            connection requests.</li>
          <li>Impact: Consumes server resources or fills the connection table, leading
            to denial of service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prevention and mitigation of DoS attacks typically involve network security
          measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and traffic filtering.</p>
