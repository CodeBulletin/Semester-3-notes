       <h1>Q4</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) What is key-logging, and what are various types of key-loggers can you Provide an in-depth explanation of how each type of key-logger operates? Additionally, what tool can be used to detect the presence of key-loggers</h2>
        <h4>What is Keylogging?</h4>
        <p>Keylogging, also known as keystroke logging, involves recording the keys
          struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, to monitor and record user actions.
          It is commonly used in cyberattacks to capture sensitive information like
          passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages.</p>
        <h4>Types of Keyloggers and Their Operations</h4>
        <p><strong>Hardware Keyloggers</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Operation</strong>: These are physical devices plugged into a
            computer between the keyboard and the PC port. They record keystrokes directly
            from the keyboard.</li>
          <li><strong>Detection</strong>: Hardware keyloggers can be detected by physically
            checking for unknown devices connected to the keyboard port.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Software Keyloggers</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kernel-Based</strong>: Operates at the kernel level of the OS,
            capturing keystrokes directly from the input subsystem. It's challenging
            to detect due to its deep integration.</li>
          <li><strong>API-Based</strong>: Uses application programming interfaces to
            monitor keyboard inputs. It can capture specific information like window
            titles.</li>
          <li><strong>Form Grabbing-Based</strong>: Records form data before it's passed
            over the Internet. Often used in capturing web form data like login credentials.</li>
          <li><strong>JavaScript-Based</strong>: Deployed on websites, capturing keystrokes
            as they occur in form fields on web pages.</li>
          <li><strong>Detection for Software Keyloggers</strong>: Software-based keyloggers
            can be detected using anti-malware or anti-keylogger software, which scans
            for suspicious activities or known keylogging programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Tools for Detecting Keyloggers</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anti-Malware Software</strong>: Many comprehensive anti-malware
            solutions have capabilities to detect both hardware and software keyloggers.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-Keylogger Software</strong>: Specialized software designed
            specifically to detect and remove keylogging software.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Analysis Tools</strong>: Some advanced users may use
            security and system analysis tools to monitor system processes and network
            traffic for signs of keylogging activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(b) Compare and contrast a virus from &amp; Worm, Elaborate any four different virus and their implications on system security.</h2>
        <h4>Comparison</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Propagation</strong>: Viruses require human action to replicate
            (like opening a file), whereas worms can self-replicate and spread independently.</li>
          <li><strong>Attachment</strong>: Viruses attach themselves to files and require
            a host for spreading. Worms are standalone software and do not need to
            attach to other programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Examples of Viruses and Their Implications</h4>
        <p><strong>ILOVEYOU Virus</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nature: A computer virus that spread via email.</li>
          <li>Impact: Overwrote files and spread itself by hijacking the victim's email
            system to send itself to contacts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conficker Virus</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nature: A virus that exploits a vulnerability in Windows OS.</li>
          <li>Impact: Forms a botnet; used for spamming and installing malicious software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Slammer Worm</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nature: A fast-spreading worm targeting Microsoft SQL 2000 servers.</li>
          <li>Impact: Caused widespread internet outages and affected banking systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Stuxnet Worm</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nature: A sophisticated worm targeting industrial control systems.</li>
          <li>Impact: Damaged Iran's nuclear program; highlighted the potential for
            cyber warfare.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(c) Explain tradition techniques of attacks on wireless network</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Eavesdropping</strong>: Interception of communications over wireless
            networks. Attackers capture unencrypted wireless data, gaining access to
            sensitive information.</li>
          <li><strong>Unauthorized Access</strong>: Gaining access to a wireless network
            without permission, often by breaking encryption or using default passwords.</li>
          <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</strong>: Intercepting and altering
            the communication between two parties in a wireless network.</li>
          <li><strong>Spoofing</strong>: Creating a rogue wireless access point that
            mimics a legitimate one, tricking users into connecting to it.</li>
          <li><strong>Denial-of-Service Attacks</strong>: Flooding a wireless network
            with traffic to make it unavailable to its intended users.</li>
          <li><strong>Evil Twin Attacks</strong>: Setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point
            with a name similar to a legitimate network, tricking users into connecting
            and capturing their data.</li>
        </ul>
