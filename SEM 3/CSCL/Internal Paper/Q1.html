        <h2>(c) What is Cyber Warfare, and how does it differ from Cyber Terrorism?.</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Cyber warfare and cyber terrorism are related concepts that involve the
          use of technology and digital means to achieve specific objectives, often
          with significant implications for national security and public safety.
          However, they differ in terms of their goals, actors involved, and the
          context in which they occur. Here's an overview of each:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cyber Warfare</strong>:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Cyber warfare refers to the use of digital
          techniques, such as hacking, computer viruses, and other forms of cyberattacks,
          by nation-states or state-sponsored groups to conduct military operations,
          intelligence activities, or sabotage against other nations or their military
          assets.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Goals</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To gain a military advantage during conflicts by disrupting the enemy's
            communication systems, targeting critical infrastructure, or compromising
            military networks.</li>
          <li>To collect intelligence on adversaries.</li>
          <li>To engage in covert and deniable operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Actors</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nation-states and their military or intelligence agencies.</li>
          <li>State-sponsored hacking groups or cyber units.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Context</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Typically occurs during international conflicts or as part of a nation's
            defense and intelligence activities.</li>
          <li>Operates within the framework of international laws and treaties (though
            enforcing these laws in cyberspace can be challenging).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cyber Terrorism</strong>:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Cyber terrorism involves the use of digital
          tools and tactics by non-state actors or terrorist organizations to advance
          their political, ideological, or religious goals through acts of terror
          or violence. These acts can cause fear, disrupt critical infrastructure,
          and harm civilians.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Goals</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To create fear and chaos among the population.</li>
          <li>To undermine government authority or policies.</li>
          <li>To advance ideological or religious objectives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Actors</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations or individuals.</li>
          <li>These actors may operate independently or as part of larger extremist
            groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Context</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Typically, cyber terrorism is aimed at causing panic and harm rather than
            achieving specific military or intelligence objectives.</li>
          <li>Often involves attacks on civilian targets or critical infrastructure,
            like power grids or transportation systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(d) Compare and contrast push and pull attack.</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">"Push" and "pull" attacks are terms often used in the context of cybersecurity
          to describe different approaches that attackers may employ to compromise
          a system or gain unauthorized access. These two attack methods have distinct
          characteristics and strategies. Here's a comparison and contrast of push
          and pull attacks:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Push Attack</strong>:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A push attack, also known as an "active attack," involves the attacker
            actively sending malicious data or commands to a target system or network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Characteristics</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The attacker takes the initiative and makes the first move.</li>
          <li>Typically involves sending malware, exploiting vulnerabilities, or launching
            direct attacks (e.g., DDoS attacks) against the target.</li>
          <li>The attacker is responsible for initiating and maintaining the attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Distributing malware via email attachments.</li>
          <li>Executing a brute force attack to guess passwords.</li>
          <li>Launching a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to overwhelm a website's servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Detection</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Push attacks are relatively more straightforward to detect since they
            involve active actions by the attacker, leaving traces in logs and network
            traffic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Pull Attack</strong>:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pull attack, also known as a "passive attack," relies on luring or tricking
            a user or system into retrieving malicious content or executing malicious
            code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Characteristics</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The attacker sets up bait or malicious content and waits for the victim
            to initiate the retrieval or execution.</li>
          <li>Often involves social engineering techniques to deceive the victim into
            taking the desired action.</li>
          <li>The attacker may remain relatively passive after the initial setup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phishing emails that persuade recipients to click on a link leading to
            a malicious website.</li>
          <li>Malicious websites or advertisements that trick users into downloading
            malware.</li>
          <li>Watering hole attacks, where attackers compromise a website frequently
            visited by their target audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Detection</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pull attacks can be more challenging to detect since the attacker relies
            on the victim's actions. Traditional security measures like antivirus software
            may not catch these attacks if they rely on previously unknown vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparison</strong>:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Initiation</strong>: Push attacks are initiated by the attacker,
          while pull attacks rely on the victim's actions to initiate the attack.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Visibility</strong>: Push attacks are often more visible and leave
          traces in logs and network traffic, making them potentially easier to detect.
          Pull attacks may be less visible and may require more sophisticated detection
          techniques.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Examples</strong>: Push attacks often involve direct exploitation
            or intrusion, while pull attacks often involve deception and manipulation.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Responsibility</strong>: In push attacks, the attacker takes responsibility
            for maintaining the attack. In pull attacks, the attacker relies on the
            victim to complete the attack.</p>
            <h2>(e) Explain the concept of Social Engineering in the context of Cyber Security. Provide 3 examples.</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Social engineering is a psychological manipulation technique used by malicious
              actors to deceive individuals or organizations into revealing sensitive
              information, performing actions, or compromising security. It is a common
              and effective method employed in the context of cybersecurity, as it exploits
              human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Here's an explanation
              of the concept of social engineering along with three examples:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Phishing</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Phishing is one of the most prevalent social
                engineering tactics. It involves sending deceptive emails, messages, or
                websites that impersonate trusted entities, such as banks, government agencies,
                or well-known companies. The goal is to trick recipients into divulging
                personal information like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or
                installing malware.</li>
              <li><strong>Example</strong>: An attacker sends an email that appears to be
                from a popular social media platform, claiming that the recipient's account
                has been compromised. The email includes a link that leads to a fake login
                page, where the victim unwittingly enters their credentials, which the
                attacker then collects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Pretexting</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Pretexting involves an attacker creating
                a fabricated scenario or pretext to gain the trust of the victim. The attacker
                typically poses as someone in authority or a position of trust, such as
                a colleague, technical support agent, or government official, and uses
                this fake identity to elicit sensitive information.</li>
              <li><strong>Example</strong>: An attacker calls an employee at a company's
                help desk, pretending to be an IT technician from headquarters. They explain
                that they need to verify the employee's account information for a system
                upgrade and request the user's username and password to carry out the verification.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Tailgating (Piggybacking)</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Explanation</strong>: Tailgating, also known as piggybacking,
                is a physical social engineering tactic. It involves an attacker following
                an authorized person into a secure area, building, or facility by pretending
                to be an employee or visitor. This relies on the politeness or lack of
                vigilance of individuals with access privileges.</li>
              <li><strong>Example</strong>: An attacker dressed as a delivery person stands
                outside a secure office building, waiting for an employee to enter. As
                an employee swipes their access card or enters a code to unlock the door,
                the attacker slips in behind them, gaining unauthorized access to the building.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>(f) What is blue jacking, and how does it differ from blue snarfing</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bluejacking</strong> and <strong>bluesnarfing</strong> are two different
              terms related to Bluetooth technology and wireless device security. They
              involve unauthorized access or manipulation of Bluetooth-enabled devices,
              but they differ in their goals and methods:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bluejacking</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Bluejacking is a relatively harmless practice
                that involves sending unsolicited messages or digital business cards (vCards)
                to other Bluetooth-enabled devices within close proximity. The goal of
                bluejacking is not to steal data or access the device but rather to surprise
                or annoy the recipient by sending them unexpected messages.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Method</strong>: Bluejackers typically exploit a Bluetooth device's
                discoverability mode to send messages or vCards to nearby devices that
                are also in discoverable mode. The recipient doesn't need to accept the
                message, as it is often automatically received.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Purpose</strong>: Bluejacking is usually done for fun, pranks,
                or to draw attention to the potential security risks of leaving Bluetooth
                discoverability mode enabled. It does not involve malicious intent.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bluesnarfing</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Bluesnarfing, on the other hand, is a malicious
                practice that aims to gain unauthorized access to a Bluetooth-enabled device,
                such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, to steal data from it, particularly
                personal information like contacts, emails, or files.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Method</strong>: Bluesnarfing involves exploiting vulnerabilities
                in a Bluetooth device's security, typically by using specialized software
                or tools. The attacker attempts to establish a connection with the target
                device without the user's knowledge or consent, often through the device's
                Bluetooth service, and then proceeds to extract or manipulate data.</li>
              <li
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Purpose</strong>: Bluesnarfing is a cybercrime, as it involves
                the theft of sensitive information for malicious purposes, such as identity
                theft or financial fraud. It is illegal and a serious security threat.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Intent</strong>: Bluejacking is harmless and usually done for
                fun or to raise awareness about Bluetooth security, while bluesnarfing
                is malicious and aims to steal sensitive data.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Method</strong>: Bluejacking involves sending unsolicited messages
                or vCards to devices in discoverable mode, whereas bluesnarfing exploits
                security vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to devices.</li>
              <li
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Impact</strong>: Bluejacking is more of an annoyance to the recipient,
                while bluesnarfing can result in significant harm, including data theft
                and privacy breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>(g) Contrast and compare fact and opinion with respect to cyber defamation.</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">In the context of cyber defamation, it's important to distinguish between
              "fact" and "opinion" as these concepts play a crucial role in legal and
              ethical considerations. Cyber defamation refers to the act of making false
              statements or spreading damaging information about someone online with
              the intent to harm their reputation. Here's a comparison and contrast of
              fact and opinion in the context of cyber defamation:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Fact</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Definition</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>A fact is a statement that can be objectively proven to be true or false.
                    It is based on verifiable evidence and can be independently corroborated.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Characteristics</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>Facts are objective and do not depend on personal beliefs or perspectives.</li>
                  <li>They can be substantiated with concrete evidence, such as documents, records,
                    or witnesses.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Role in Cyber Defamation</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>False statements presented as facts in cyber defamation cases can be particularly
                    damaging since they are portrayed as truthful and can harm a person's reputation
                    and credibility.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Opinion</strong>:</p>

                  <li>Expressing opinions, even negative ones, typically falls under the realm
                    of free speech and is less likely to constitute defamation, as long as
                    they are clearly presented as opinions and not stated as false facts.</li>

            <ol>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Verifiability</strong>: Facts can be independently verified and
                proven to be true or false, while opinions are subjective and cannot be
                definitively proven or disproven.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Legal Protection</strong>: Opinions are often protected by freedom
                of speech laws, which means individuals have the right to express their
                opinions, even if they are negative or critical. However, presenting opinions
                as facts can lead to legal liability for defamation.</li>
              <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Impact</strong>: False statements presented as facts in cyber
                defamation cases can be particularly damaging to a person's reputation
                and can lead to legal consequences, while negative opinions, if clearly
                stated as such, may have less severe consequences.</li>

            <h2>(h) Describe the concept of stenography and how it can be used in cyber attacks. Provide examples of stenography techniques.</h2>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Steganography</strong> is a technique used to hide or embed information
              within other data (such as images, audio files, or text) in a way that
              is not readily apparent to the casual observer. The goal of steganography
              is to conceal the existence of the embedded data, making it difficult to
              detect or decode without specific knowledge and tools. In the context of
              cyber attacks, steganography can be employed for malicious purposes, allowing
              attackers to hide malicious code, commands, or sensitive information within
              seemingly innocent files or communication channels. Here's an explanation
              of steganography and some examples of steganography techniques used in
              cyber attacks:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Concept of Steganography</strong>:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Embedding Data</strong>: Steganography involves the process of
              embedding hidden data (often referred to as the "payload") into a carrier
              file or medium, which can be an image, audio file, video, or even a text
              document.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Key Features</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Inconspicuousness</strong>: The primary goal is to make the presence
                of the hidden data as inconspicuous as possible so that it escapes detection
                by visual or statistical analysis.</li>
              <li><strong>Imperceptibility</strong>: The changes made to the carrier file
                should be imperceptible to the human senses (e.g., human eyes or ears).</li>
              <li><strong>Extraction</strong>: A recipient with knowledge of the steganographic
                technique and the correct decryption key can extract the hidden data from
                the carrier file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Use Cases</strong>: Steganography has both legitimate and malicious
              applications. In cybersecurity, it can be employed for covert communication,
              data exfiltration, or the concealment of malware and malicious commands.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Examples of Steganography Techniques in Cyber Attacks</strong>:</p>
              <p
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Image Steganography</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Technique</strong>: Embedding data within image files by subtly
                    modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of the pixel values.</li>
                  <li><strong>Example</strong>: An attacker might hide malware code within an
                    innocent-looking image and share it on a website or in an email attachment.
                    When a victim downloads and opens the image, the malware is extracted and
                    executed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Audio Steganography</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Technique</strong>: Hiding data within audio files by modifying
                    the amplitude or frequency of audio samples.</li>
                  <li><strong>Example</strong>: A cybercriminal might conceal encrypted data
                    within an audio recording and then share it as part of a podcast or music
                    file. This data can be extracted by someone with the decryption key.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Text Steganography</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Technique</strong>: Embedding hidden messages within text by altering
                    the formatting, spacing, or encoding in a way that is not immediately noticeable.</li>
                  <li><strong>Example</strong>: In a phishing attack, an attacker could embed
                    malicious URLs within an email's text, making them appear as harmless plain
                    text links to the recipient. This makes the phishing attempt less conspicuous.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Network Steganography</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Technique</strong>: Hiding data within network protocols or traffic
                    patterns, such as TCP/IP headers or DNS queries.</li>
                  <li><strong>Example</strong>: A cybercriminal might embed sensitive information
                    within seemingly legitimate network traffic, making it harder for security
                    systems to detect data leakage or unauthorized communication.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>File Format Steganography</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Technique</strong>: Using specific file formats or compression
                    algorithms that allow the embedding of data without significantly altering
                    the file's appearance or functionality.</li>
                  <li><strong>Example</strong>: Attackers could use a file format that supports
                    data embedding to hide malicious scripts within seemingly harmless documents,
                    such as PDFs or Microsoft Office files.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>(i) Enlist 5 examples of cyber stalking</h2>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Email Harassment</strong>: The stalker sends numerous, threatening,
                  or abusive emails to the victim. These emails may contain explicit content,
                  hate speech, or threats, causing emotional distress and fear for the victim's
                  safety.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Social Media Stalking</strong>: The stalker continuously monitors
                  the victim's social media profiles, often without the victim's knowledge,
                  and may engage in activities such as posting offensive comments, sharing
                  personal information, or creating fake accounts to impersonate or harass
                  the victim.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Doxxing</strong>: The stalker searches for and publishes the victim's
                  personal information, such as their home address, phone number, email,
                  or workplace, with the intention of causing harm or encouraging others
                  to do so. Doxxing can lead to real-life harassment or stalking.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Online Threats</strong>: The stalker sends threatening messages
                  or posts public threats on forums, social media, or other online platforms.
                  These threats may include physical harm, sexual assault, or other forms
                  of violence, causing significant distress to the victim.</p>
                <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>GPS Tracking and Location Sharing</strong>: In some cases, cyberstalkers
                  use GPS tracking or location-sharing apps to monitor the victim's physical
                  movements and whereabouts. They may gain unauthorized access to the victim's
                  smartphone or use malicious apps to track their location.</p>
