        <h2>(a) Compare and contrast between IDS(Intrusion Detection System) and IPS(Intrusion Prevention System).&nbsp;</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
          are critical components of network security, but they serve different roles
          and have distinct functionalities. Here's a comparison and contrast between
          the two:</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Function</strong>: An IDS monitors network and/or system activities
          for malicious activities or policy violations. It typically works in a
          passive mode, analyzing copies of network traffic.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Response to Threats</strong>: When an IDS detects a potential
          threat, it logs the information and alerts system administrators. However,
          it does not take action to stop the threat.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Deployment</strong>: IDS can be network-based (NIDS), monitoring
          traffic from all devices on the network, or host-based (HIDS), monitoring
          activity on a single host.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Detection Methods</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Signature-Based Detection</strong>: Detects known threats by looking
            for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known
            malicious instruction sequences.</li>
          <li><strong>Anomaly-Based Detection</strong>: Detects unknown threats by comparing
            current activity to a baseline and looking for anomalies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Effective in identifying known threats.</li>
          <li>Provides detailed information about detected intrusions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cannot prevent detected threats.</li>
          <li>High false positive rate, especially in anomaly-based detection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Function</strong>: An IPS, similar to an IDS, monitors network
          and/or system activities, but it can also actively block or prevent intrusions.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Response to Threats</strong>: When an IPS identifies a potential
          threat, it can take action to block the threat, such as dropping malicious
          packets, resetting connections, or blocking traffic from the source IP
          address.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Deployment</strong>: Like IDS, IPS can be network-based or host-based.
            It is typically placed inline (directly in the traffic flow) to actively
            monitor and respond to network traffic.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Detection Methods</strong>: Uses similar methods as IDS (signature-based
            and anomaly-based detection), but also includes other techniques like stateful
            inspection.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Can prevent or mitigate attacks in real-time.</li>
            <li>Reduces the burden on security teams by automatically responding to threats.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Risk of false positives leading to legitimate traffic being blocked.</li>
            <li>Can become a point of failure in the network if not properly managed.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Comparison and Contrast</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Active vs Passive</strong>: The primary difference is that IDS
            is passive and only detects and alerts, while IPS is active and can prevent
            or mitigate attacks.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Placement in Network</strong>: IPS is usually placed inline to
            actively monitor and control the traffic, whereas IDS is typically deployed
            out of band.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>False Positives</strong>: Both systems can generate false positives,
            but the consequences are more significant in IPS as it can lead to legitimate
            traffic being blocked.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Complexity and Management</strong>: IPS is generally more complex
            to manage due to its active role in network traffic. Misconfigurations
            can have a direct impact on network performance.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Use Case</strong>: IDS is suitable for environments where detecting
            threats and understanding attack patterns are crucial but active intervention
            is not desired, while IPS is ideal for environments where preventing known
            threats is a priority.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">In summary, IDS and IPS are complementary technologies, with IDS suited
            for monitoring and identifying security breaches and IPS aimed at actively
            preventing and mitigating attacks. The choice between IDS and IPS, or the
            decision to use both, depends on the specific security needs and policies
            of the organization.</p>
          <h2>(b) What are the various intrusion detection methodologies? Also, explain any three types of threats.</h2>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) employ various methodologies to detect
            unauthorized access or anomalies in a network or system. The primary intrusion
            detection methodologies are:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Signature-Based Detection</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: This method relies on a database of known
              threat signatures - patterns of data that are typical of known malicious
              activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation</strong>: The IDS compares incoming traffic against
              these signatures to identify potential threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Highly effective at detecting known threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Cannot detect new, unknown threats (zero-day attacks).</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Anomaly-Based Detection</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: This approach involves establishing a baseline
              of normal network behavior and then monitoring for deviations from this
              norm.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation</strong>: It uses machine learning algorithms or statistical
              analysis to detect unusual patterns that may indicate a security breach.</li>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Capable of detecting novel or unknown threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Higher false positive rates as benign activities
              that are not typical may be flagged as threats.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Stateful Protocol Analysis</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: This method interprets various protocols
              and data transfers to determine if they are behaving as expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation</strong>: It understands and tracks the state of network
              protocols over a session, ensuring they adhere to the defined protocol
              standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Effective in identifying protocol-specific attacks
              and anomalies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Requires deep knowledge of protocols and can be
              resource-intensive.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Heuristic-Based Detection</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: Uses algorithms to evaluate the behavior
              of applications and network traffic, looking for unusual patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation</strong>: It identifies potentially harmful software
              or activity by comparing it to known harmful behaviors.</li>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Good at detecting new threats that haven't been
              encountered before.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Risk of false positives is high due to the heuristic
              nature of detection.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Types of Threats</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Network Attacks</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: Attacks aimed at disrupting, damaging, or
              gaining unauthorized access to computer networks and systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples</strong>: DDoS attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks,
              and packet sniffing.</li>
            <li><strong>Concerns</strong>: These attacks can compromise network integrity,
              steal data, or render network services unavailable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Malware</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: Malicious software designed to harm, exploit,
              or take unauthorized control over a system.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.</li>
            <li><strong>Concerns</strong>: Malware can lead to data theft, system damage,
              spying, and other malicious activities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Insider Threats</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: Threats from people within the organization
              who have inside information concerning its security practices, data, and
              computer systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Employees misusing access privileges, stealing
              confidential information, or sabotaging systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Concerns</strong>: These threats are hard to detect as insiders
              already have authorized access, and their actions can lead to significant
              damage or data breaches.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Each of these threats requires specific strategies and tools to detect
            and mitigate, emphasizing the need for a multi-layered approach to security
            that includes robust intrusion detection capabilities.</p>
