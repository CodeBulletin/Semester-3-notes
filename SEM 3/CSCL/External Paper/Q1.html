       <h1>Q1</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) What is digital media forensics?</h2>
        <p>Digital media forensics is a branch of digital forensics that focuses
          on the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of digital
          media. This includes images, audio, and video files. The goal is to uncover
          evidence and authenticate or debunk the digital media's integrity and origin,
          often in the context of criminal or civil investigations.</p>
        <h2>(b) Differentiate among Worms, Viruses, and Trojan Horses.&nbsp;</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Worms</strong>: Self-replicating malware that spreads independently
            across networks. They exploit vulnerabilities in software to spread to
            other computers without human interaction. Example: Conficker Worm.</li>
          <li><strong>Viruses</strong>: Malware that attaches itself to a program or
            file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another, typically requiring
            human action (like opening a file). Example: ILOVEYOU Virus.</li>
          <li><strong>Trojan Horses</strong>: Disguised as legitimate software, Trojans
            trick users into installing them. Unlike viruses and worms, they don't
            self-replicate but can be just as destructive. Example: Zeus Trojan.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(c) Is there a difference between "cybercrime" and "cyberfraud"? Explain.&nbsp;</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cybercrime</strong> is a broader term encompassing any criminal
            activity that involves a computer or network. It includes a wide range
            of offenses like hacking, online harassment, and identity theft.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyberfraud</strong> is a subset of cybercrime, specifically focusing
            on fraud committed using digital technology. This includes activities like
            phishing, credit card frauds, and online scams. Cyberfraud is always about
            deception for financial or personal gain, whereas cybercrime can have various
            motives.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(d) Define digital media forensics?</h2>
        <p>Digital media forensics is a branch of digital forensics that focuses
          on the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of digital
          media. This includes images, audio, and video files. The goal is to uncover
          evidence and authenticate or debunk the digital media's integrity and origin,
          often in the context of criminal or civil investigations.</p>
        <h2>(e) Differentiate between passive and active attacks with examples.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Passive Attacks</strong>: Involves eavesdropping on or monitoring
            systems without affecting them. Example: Sniffing network traffic to capture
            unencrypted data.</li>
          <li><strong>Active Attacks</strong>: Involves direct interference with the
            operations of a system or network. Example: DDoS (Distributed Denial of
            Service) attacks that overwhelm a system with traffic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(f) What is a Blind SQL injection attack?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>A Blind SQL Injection attack is a type of SQL Injection where the attacker
          asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer based
          on the application's response. This method is used when the attacker doesn't
          receive direct data from the database.</p>
        <h2>(g) What is a virus hoax?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>A virus hoax is a false warning about a computer virus. Typically, it
          is a message warning the users of a non-existent virus, often causing unnecessary
          panic and can lead to misinformed or harmful actions, like deleting important
          system files.</p>
        <h2>(h) What do you understand by the salient features of the Indian IT Act?</h2>
        <p>The Indian Information Technology (IT) Act primarily addresses legal challenges
          related to internet usage, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. Key features
          include recognition of electronic records and digital signatures, provisions
          for cybercrime and data protection, and regulations for intermediaries
          and e-governance.</p>
        <h2>(i) Describe the main principles of information security?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Ensuring that information is accessible
            only to those authorized.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of
            data.</li>
          <li><strong>Availability</strong>: Ensuring that information is available
            when needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-repudiation</strong>: Guaranteeing that a person or entity
            cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a message
            they sent.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>(j) What is the work of WIPO?</h2>
        <p>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a global forum
          for intellectual property (IP) services, policy, information, and cooperation.
          It is a self-funding agency of the United Nations, dedicated to developing
          a balanced and accessible international IP system. WIPO's work includes
          helping to shape international IP laws, providing services for protecting
          IP across nations, resolving disputes, and delivering capacity-building
          programs to enable effective use of IP.</p>
