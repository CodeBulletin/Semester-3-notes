       <h1>Q3</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) Discuss the various type of deliberate software attacks designed to damage, destroy or deny service to target systems?</h2>
        <p><strong>Virus Attacks</strong>: Viruses are malicious programs that attach
          themselves to clean files and spread throughout a computer system, corrupting
          files and affecting the performance of a system. They often require some
          form of user action to activate and spread.</p>
        <p><strong>Worm Attacks</strong>: Worms are similar to viruses, but they
          can spread autonomously without human intervention. They exploit vulnerabilities
          in software or operating systems and can cause widespread damage by replicating
          rapidly across networks.</p>
        <p><strong>Trojan Horse Attacks</strong>: Trojans disguise themselves as
          legitimate software but perform malicious actions when executed. They can
          steal data, spy on users, or create backdoors for further attacks.</p>
        <p><strong>Ransomware Attacks</strong>: Ransomware encrypts a user's data
          and demands payment for the decryption key. These attacks can lock users
          out of their systems and can cause significant data loss.</p>
        <p><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks</strong>:
          DoS and DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm a system's resources or the bandwidth
          of a network, making the service inaccessible to legitimate users. DDoS
          attacks use multiple compromised systems to launch the attack.</p>
        <p><strong>SQL Injection Attacks</strong>: These attacks target databases
          through web applications. Attackers manipulate standard SQL queries to
          gain unauthorized access to data, modify database information, and execute
          administrative operations on databases.</p>
        <p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks</strong>: In XSS attacks, attackers
          inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. This can
          lead to hijacking of user sessions, defacing websites, or redirecting the
          user to malicious sites.</p>
        <p><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</strong>: These occur when attackers
          intercept and alter the communication between two parties without their
          knowledge, often in unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.</p>
        <p><strong>Zero-Day Exploits</strong>: These attacks exploit vulnerabilities
          in software or hardware that are unknown to the vendor or have no patch
          available at the time of the attack.</p>
        <h2>(b) What are the various essential challenges in mobile security?</h2>
        <p><strong>Device Loss or Theft</strong>: Mobile devices are portable and
          easily lost or stolen, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive
          information.</p>
        <p><strong>Insecure Wi-Fi Networks</strong>: Mobile users often connect to
          public Wi-Fi networks, which may not be secure, exposing them to risks
          like MitM attacks.</p>
        <p><strong>Vulnerabilities in Mobile Operating Systems</strong>: Like any
          software, mobile OS can have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.</p>
        <p><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>: Mobile users are increasingly targeted
          by phishing attacks, often through emails or malicious apps, due to the
          smaller screen size and simplified user interface which can make fraudulent
          content less noticeable.</p>
        <p><strong>Malware and Viruses</strong>: The proliferation of mobile apps
          has increased the risk of downloading apps containing malware or viruses.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Leakage</strong>: Unintentional data leakage due to app permissions,
          where apps access more data than needed, can be a significant risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Outdated Software</strong>: Not regularly updating the mobile
          OS and apps can leave security vulnerabilities unpatched.</p>
        <p><strong>Unsecured Apps</strong>: Downloading apps from unofficial or unsecured
          sources can increase the risk of installing malicious software.</p>
        <p><strong>IoT Integration</strong>: As mobile devices increasingly integrate
          with other IoT devices, the security of these interconnected systems can
          become a concern.</p>
        <p><strong>User Negligence</strong>: Often, the biggest security risk comes
          from the users themselves, whether through weak passwords, sharing sensitive
          information, or lack of awareness about security practices.</p>
