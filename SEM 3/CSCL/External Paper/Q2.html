        <h2>(a) What is the cyber threat? How it is different from cybercrime? How do we classify cybercrimes? Explain each one briefly.</h2>
        <h4>Cyber Threat</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: A cyber threat is a potential risk or danger
            to information or systems posed by the use of digital technologies and
            networks. It includes a variety of malicious activities that can compromise
            the security, integrity, or availability of digital assets.</li>
          <li><strong>Nature</strong>: Cyber threats are not necessarily actions but
            potential or identified risks that might lead to harmful activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Difference from Cybercrime</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cyber Threat</strong>: Broad and includes any potential harmful
            activity in the cyber environment. It encompasses various risks and vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Cybercrime</strong>: Specific illegal activities conducted through
            digital means. It refers to actual criminal offenses involving computers
            and networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cybercrimes can be classified into various categories based on the nature
          of the offense</p>

        <h6><strong>5. Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroup</strong>:&nbsp;</h6>
        <p>Crimes emanating from Usenet newsgroups refer to illegal activities that
          are conducted through Usenet, a decentralized network of discussion forums
          and message boards. While Usenet itself is a legitimate platform for exchanging
          information and engaging in discussions, it can also be misused for criminal
          purposes. Here are some examples of crimes that can occur on Usenet:</p>
        <h2>(b) Explain the working of email spoofing. Discuss the preventive measures to protect from email spoofing.</h2>
        <h4>Working of Email Spoofing</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Process</strong>: Email spoofing involves forging an email header
            to make it appear as though it originated from a different source than
            the actual one. The “From” address is manipulated to show a familiar or
            trusted email address to the recipient.</li>
          <li><strong>Objective</strong>: The main goal is often to trick the recipient
            into believing that the message is from a legitimate source, which can
            be used for phishing, spreading malware, or fraud.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preventive Measures</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Use of Email Authentication Methods</strong>: Implementing protocols
            like SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail),
            and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
            can help in verifying the authenticity of the sender.</li>
          <li><strong>Awareness and Vigilance</strong>: Educating users to recognize
            signs of spoofed emails, such as mismatched URLs, poor grammar, and unsolicited
            requests for sensitive information.</li>
          <li><strong>Regularly Update Security Software</strong>: Keeping anti-virus
            and anti-malware software updated can help in detecting and preventing
            threats from spoofed emails.</li>
          <li><strong>Verify Suspicious Emails</strong>: If an email seems suspicious,
            it’s advisable to verify it by contacting the sender through other means.</li>
          <li><strong>Use of Secure Email Gateways</strong>: Deploying secure email
            gateways can filter out malicious emails, including those that are spoofed.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links or Attachments</strong>: Users
            should avoid interacting with any suspicious elements within emails that
            seem out of character for the supposed sender.</li>
