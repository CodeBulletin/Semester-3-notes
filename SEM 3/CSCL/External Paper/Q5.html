       <h1>Q5</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <h2>(a) Suppose that you have a message consisting of 1024 bits. Design a method that will extend a key that is 64 bits long into a string of. 1024 bits, so that. the resulting 1024 bits can be XORed with the message, &nbsp;just like a one-time pad. Is the resulting cipher as secure as a one-time pad? Is it possible for any such cipher to be as secure as a one-time pad?</h2>
        <h4>Designing the Method</h4>
        <p>To extend a 64-bit key into a 1024-bit string for XORing with a 1024-bit
          message, a common approach would be to use a pseudorandom number generator
          (PRNG) seeded with the 64-bit key. This PRNG would generate a stream of
          bits that repeats every 64 bits to achieve the length of 1024 bits.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Seed the PRNG with the 64-bit Key</strong>: Initialize the PRNG
            with the given key.</li>
          <li><strong>Generate Bits</strong>: Use the PRNG to generate a bitstream until
            it reaches 1024 bits in length.</li>
          <li><strong>XOR Operation</strong>: XOR this 1024-bit extended key with the
            original message.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Security Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Comparison with One-Time Pad</strong>: A true one-time pad (OTP)
            requires the key to be as long as the message, completely random, and used
            only once. In this case, since the key is shorter than the message and
            extended via a deterministic process (PRNG), the resulting cipher is not
            as secure as a one-time pad.</li>
          <li><strong>Predictability</strong>: Given the repetitive nature of the extended
            key (every 64 bits), it becomes more predictable and vulnerable to cryptanalysis,
            unlike the OTP which is completely random and provides perfect secrecy.</li>
          <li><strong>Practical Security</strong>: While this method can provide a certain
            level of security, it is vulnerable to attacks that are not a concern with
            a one-time pad.</li>
          <li><strong>Inherent Limitation</strong>: No cipher that reuses a key or generates
            a key stream from a smaller key can be as secure as a one-time pad, as
            the fundamental strength of an OTP lies in its key being random, as long
            as the message, and never reused.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(b) What is cryptography and also explain Symmetric-key cryptography and Asymmetric cryptography?</h2>
        <h4>What is Cryptography?</h4>
        <p>Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication
          and information from adversaries. It involves creating written or generated
          codes that allow information to be kept secret.</p>
        <h4>Symmetric-key Cryptography</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Symmetric-key cryptography uses the same
            key for both encryption and decryption.</li>
          <li><strong>Operation</strong>: The sender and receiver must both possess
            the secret key and keep it confidential.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES
            (Data Encryption Standard).</li>
          <li><strong>Use-Case</strong>: It's widely used for its efficiency in encrypting
            large amounts of data and is commonly employed in everyday security protocols
            like SSL/TLS for internet communications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Asymmetric Cryptography</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key
            cryptography, uses two different keys – a public key and a private key.</li>
          <li><strong>Operation</strong>: The public key is available to everyone and
            is used for encrypting messages. The private key is secret and is used
            to decrypt the messages.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic
            Curve Cryptography).</li>
          <li><strong>Use-Case</strong>: It is essential for establishing secure communications
            over an insecure medium like the Internet, used in digital signatures,
            and for secure key exchange mechanisms.</li>
