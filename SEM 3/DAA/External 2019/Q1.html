        <h2>(f) What do you understand by greedy algorithms? Do greedy algorithms always yield optimal solution? Support with an example.</h2>
        <p>Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal
          choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution.
          In other words, they make the best choice at each stage without considering
          the overall consequences. Greedy algorithms are often used for optimization
          problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of possible
          solutions.</p>
        <p>The key characteristic of greedy algorithms is that they make decisions
          based on the current information available, without considering the future
          implications. This can lead to efficient solutions for certain problems,
          but it does not guarantee the optimal solution in all cases.</p>
        <p>One example of a greedy algorithm is the "coin change" problem, where
          the goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain
          amount of change. The greedy approach would involve selecting the largest
          denomination coin at each step until the desired amount is reached. However,
          this approach may not always yield the optimal solution, as there may be
          cases where a combination of smaller coins would result in fewer total
          coins.</p>
        <p>Overall, greedy algorithms can be a useful tool for solving certain types
          of problems efficiently, but they may not always provide the optimal solution.
          It is important to carefully analyze the problem and consider alternative
          approaches when using greedy algorithms.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Greedy(a, n) {
