        <h2>What are disjoint sets? Give difference between link list &amp; forest implementation of disjoint sets. What is union by rank? Give functions for union, find-set and make-set operations for forest implementation by rank.</h2>
        <p>Disjoint sets, also known as union-find data structures, are a way of
          keeping track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of non-overlapping
          (disjoint) subsets. They are particularly useful in network connectivity,
          image processing, and various other applications where objects are grouped
          into disjoint sets.</p>
        <p>There are two common ways to implement disjoint sets: Linked Lists and
          Forests (or trees). Here's a comparison between the two:</p>
        <h3>Linked List Implementation</h3>
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: In the linked list implementation, each set
          is represented as a linked list. Each element of the set is a node in the
          linked list.</p>
        <p><strong>Find Operation</strong>: To find which subset a particular element
          is in, you traverse from the node to the head of the list. The head of
          the list represents the identifier for the subset.</p>
        <p><strong>Union Operation</strong>: To merge two subsets, you append the
          list of one set to the other. This operation can be inefficient if not
          managed properly, as it might require traversing the entire list.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The linked list implementation can be less
          efficient, particularly for the union operation which can take linear time
          in the worst case.</p>
        <h3>Forest (Tree) Implementation</h3>
        <p><strong>Structure</strong>: In this method, each set is represented as
          a tree. Each element is a node, and each tree represents one subset. The
          root of each tree is the representative of the set.</p>
        <p><strong>Find Operation</strong>: To find which subset an element is in,
          you follow the parent nodes until you reach the root. The root node represents
          the subset.</p>
        <p><strong>Union Operation</strong>: To merge two subsets, you attach the
          root of one tree to the root of the other. This operation is more efficient
          than in the linked list implementation, especially when combined with techniques
          like union by rank and path compression.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The forest implementation, particularly with
          optimizations like path compression and union by rank, provides very efficient
          find and union operations, often nearly constant time.</p>
        <h3>Key Differences</h3>
        <p><strong>Data Structure</strong>: Linked list uses a linear structure for
          each set, while forest uses a tree structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Forest implementation is generally more efficient,
          especially with path compression and union by rank optimizations.</p>
        <p><strong>Union Operation</strong>: Union is simpler in a linked list but
          more efficient in a forest.</p>
        <p><strong>Complexity of Find Operation</strong>: The find operation is typically
          faster in a forest, especially with path compression, as compared to a
          linked list implementation.</p>
        <p>In summary, while the linked list implementation of disjoint sets is conceptually
          simpler, the forest implementation is generally preferred for its superior
          efficiency, especially in scenarios involving large data sets and frequent
          find and union operations.</p>
        <h3>Union by Rank</h3>
        <p>"Union by rank" is an optimization technique used in the forest (tree)
          implementation of disjoint sets, particularly in the context of union-find
          data structures. Its primary goal is to keep the trees as flat as possible,
          which in turn keeps the time complexity of the 'find' operation low. Here's
          how it works:</p>
        <h3>Concept of Rank</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rank</strong>: In this context, the "rank" of a tree is a rough
            measure of its height. Initially, when each element forms its own set,
            the rank of each tree is 0.</li>
          <li><strong>Attaching Trees</strong>: When performing a 'union' operation
            (merging two disjoint sets), the root of the tree with a lower rank is
            attached to the root of the tree with a higher rank.</li>
          <li><strong>Rank Update</strong>: If the ranks of both trees are equal, one
            of them is chosen as the new root, and its rank is incremented by 1.</li>
          <li><strong>Effect on Tree Height</strong>: By always attaching the shorter
            tree to the root of the taller tree, union by rank minimizes the maximum
            height of the trees. This is crucial because the time complexity of the
            'find' operation is proportional to the height of the tree.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Benefits of Union by Rank</h3>
        <p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: This method greatly improves the efficiency
          of the union-find operations. With union by rank, the height of any tree
          in the forest remains very small, ensuring that the 'find' operation, which
          requires traversing from a node to the root of its tree, is very fast.</p>
        <p><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: With union by rank (and especially when
          combined with another optimization called path compression), the time complexity
          for both 'find' and 'union' operations can be brought down to nearly constant
          time, O(α(N))O(α(N)), where αα is the inverse Ackermann function, which
          grows very slowly and is practically constant for all reasonably large
          values of NN (number of elements).</p>
        <p>In summary, union by rank is a key optimization in union-find data structures,
          making them highly efficient for problems involving large sets and frequent
          queries for determining the set to which an element belongs or merging
          sets.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">class Node:
