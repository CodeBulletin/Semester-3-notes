        <h2>(b) Differentiate between P, NP, NP hard and NP complete problems.</h2>
        <p>The concepts of P, NP, NP-hard, and NP-complete are central to computational
          complexity theory, a branch of computer science that deals with the efficiency
          and feasibility of solving problems. These classifications help us understand
          the difficulty of solving various computational problems and whether solutions
          can be efficiently verified. Here's a differentiation among them:</p>
        <h3>P (Polynomial Time)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: P stands for "Polynomial Time" and refers
            to the class of problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine
            in polynomial time.</li>
          <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Problems in P are those for which an
            efficient solution exists. "Efficient" here means the running time of the
            algorithm is a polynomial function of the size of the input.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Problems like sorting, binary search, or finding
            the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: NP stands for "Non-deterministic Polynomial
            Time." It's a class of problems for which a proposed solution can be verified
            in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine.</li>
          <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Problems in NP are those where it's
            not necessarily known how to find a solution efficiently, but if given
            a solution, it can be checked quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Relation with P</strong>: All problems in P are also in NP (since
            if a solution can be found quickly, it can also be verified quickly). However,
            it's an open question in computer science (the famous "P vs NP" problem)
            whether all problems in NP are also in P.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Problems like the Hamiltonian Cycle problem,
            the subset sum problem, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>NP-Hard</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: NP-Hard are problems that are at least as
            hard as the hardest problems in NP. It doesn't matter if they are in NP
            or not.</li>
          <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: If any NP-hard problem can be solved
            in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can also be solved in polynomial
            time (which would mean P = NP). However, such an algorithm has not been
            discovered yet. NP-hard problems may not even be decision problems (with
            a yes/no answer).</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Problems like the traveling salesman problem,
            decision version of Sudoku, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>NP-Complete</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: NP-Complete problems are those that are both
            in NP and NP-Hard.</li>
          <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: These are the most difficult problems
            in NP. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then
            every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time (P = NP). They are
            a subset of NP and serve as a benchmark for the complexity of other NP
            problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Problems like the Boolean satisfiability problem
            (SAT), the clique problem, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>P</strong>: Problems solvable efficiently (in polynomial time).</li>
          <li><strong>NP</strong>: Problems for which a solution can be verified efficiently.</li>
          <li><strong>NP-Hard</strong>: Problems at least as hard as the hardest problems
            in NP.</li>
          <li><strong>NP-Complete</strong>: The intersection of NP and NP-Hard, representing
            the most challenging known problems in NP.</li>
        </ul>
