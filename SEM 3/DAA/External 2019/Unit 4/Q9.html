        <h2>(a) What is reducibility? State the necessary conditions for reducibility. Explain reducibility with an example.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Reducibility in computational complexity theory refers to the method of
          comparing the complexity of two problems by showing that one (the target
          problem) can be transformed or "reduced" to the other (the source problem).
          This concept is fundamental in classifying problems, particularly in demonstrating
          NP-completeness.</p>
        <h4>Necessary Conditions for Reducibility</h4>
        <p><strong>Polynomial Time Transformation</strong>: The reduction from problem
          A (source) to problem B (target) must be achievable in polynomial time.
          This means there exists an algorithm that can transform any instance of
          problem A into an instance of problem B in polynomial time.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution Preservation</strong>: The transformation must preserve
          solutions, meaning that solving the transformed instance of problem B should
          give information about the solution to the original instance of problem
          A.</p>
        <h4>Example of Reducibility</h4>
        <p>Consider the problem of the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) and the
          problem of 3-SAT (a specific version of SAT where each clause has exactly
          three literals).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SAT</strong>: Given a Boolean formula, determine if there is an
            assignment of truth values to variables that makes the entire formula true.</li>
          <li><strong>3-SAT</strong>: A special case of SAT where the formula is in
            conjunctive normal form (CNF) and each clause has exactly three literals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Reduction from SAT to 3-SAT</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We can transform any instance of SAT into an instance of 3-SAT. This involves
            rewriting the clauses in the SAT formula so that each clause has exactly
            three literals, using logical equivalences and additional variables if
            necessary.</li>
          <li>This transformation can be done in polynomial time, and a solution to
            the 3-SAT instance directly gives a solution to the original SAT instance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>(b) Explain the circuit satisfiability problem and show that it is an NP Complete problem.</h2>
        <h4>Circuit Satisfiability Problem (Circuit-SAT)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Given a combinational logic circuit (built
            from AND, OR, NOT, etc., gates) with a single output and several inputs,
            the Circuit-SAT problem asks whether there is a combination of inputs that
            results in the output being true (1).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Showing Circuit-SAT is NP-Complete</h4>
        <p><strong>Circuit-SAT is in NP</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To prove that Circuit-SAT is in NP, we need to show that if we are given
            a "certificate" (a specific input assignment), we can verify in polynomial
            time whether this assignment makes the circuit output true. This is straightforward,
            as evaluating a logic circuit with a given input is a polynomial-time task.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Reduction from a Known NP-Complete Problem</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The usual approach to show that a problem is NP-Complete is by reducing
            a known NP-Complete problem to it.</li>
          <li>For Circuit-SAT, a common strategy is to reduce from 3-SAT (known to be
            NP-Complete).</li>
          <li>Each clause in a 3-SAT formula can be represented as a small circuit with
            three inputs (the literals of the clause) and one output. These small circuits
            can be combined in a way that the entire 3-SAT formula is represented by
            a larger circuit.</li>
          <li>This reduction can be done in polynomial time, and a 3-SAT formula is
            satisfiable if and only if the corresponding circuit is satisfiable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through this reduction, we've shown that Circuit-SAT is at least as hard
          as 3-SAT, a known NP-Complete problem. Hence, Circuit-SAT is NP-Complete.</p>
