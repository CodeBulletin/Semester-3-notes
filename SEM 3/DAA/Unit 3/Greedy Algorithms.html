       <h1>Greedy Algorithms</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p><span style="background-color:rgb(52,53,65);color:rgb(209,213,219);">Greedy algorithms are a method for tackling optimization problems by making the best local choice at each step, hoping to reach an overall optimal solution. They focus on immediate benefits rather than the long-term outcome, which can lead to efficient but not always optimal results. A classic example is the coin change problem, where the algorithm picks the largest coin denomination available at each step to reach the target amount. While this method is efficient for certain scenarios, it doesn't guarantee the most optimal solution in every case, especially when a combination of smaller coins might yield a better result. Greedy algorithms are thus valuable for specific problems but require careful evaluation against other methods to ensure they're suitable for the task at hand.</span>

        <h2 style="margin-left:auto;">Greedy algorithms have a wide range of applications in various fields. Here are some common examples:</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree</strong>: Greedy algorithms like Kruskal's
          algorithm and Prim's algorithm are used to find the minimum spanning tree
          in a graph. These algorithms iteratively select edges with the minimum
          weight to construct a tree that spans all the vertices.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Shortest Path</strong>: Algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm use
          a greedy approach to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.
          They iteratively select the vertex with the minimum distance and update
          the distances of its neighboring vertices.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Huffman Coding</strong>: Huffman coding is a lossless data compression
          algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their
          frequency of occurrence. It uses a greedy approach to construct an optimal
          prefix code, where the most frequent characters have the shortest codes.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Interval Scheduling</strong>: Greedy algorithms are used to solve
          interval scheduling problems, where the goal is to select the maximum number
          of non-overlapping intervals. The algorithm sorts the intervals based on
          their end times and greedily selects the intervals that do not overlap.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Knapsack Problem</strong>: In the fractional knapsack problem,
            where items can be divided, a greedy algorithm can be used to select items
            with the maximum value-to-weight ratio until the knapsack is full. However,
            for the 0/1 knapsack problem, where items cannot be divided, a greedy approach
            does not always yield the optimal solution.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Job Scheduling</strong>: Greedy algorithms are used in job scheduling
              problems, where the goal is to schedule a set of jobs on limited resources.
              Algorithms like the earliest deadline first (EDF) and shortest job next
              (SJN) use a greedy approach to prioritize jobs based on their deadlines
              or execution times.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:auto;">These are just a few examples of how greedy algorithms can be applied.
              Greedy approaches are often used when the problem exhibits the greedy-choice
              property, meaning that making locally optimal choices leads to a globally
              optimal solution. However, it's important to note that greedy algorithms
              may not always provide the optimal solution for every problem.</p>
