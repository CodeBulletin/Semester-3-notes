       <h1>Greedy Algorithms</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal
          choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution.
          In other words, they make the best choice at each stage without considering
          the overall consequences. Greedy algorithms are often used for optimization
          problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of possible
          solutions.</p>
        <p>The key characteristic of greedy algorithms is that they make decisions
          based on the current information available, without considering the future
          implications. This can lead to efficient solutions for certain problems,
          but it does not guarantee the optimal solution in all cases.</p>
        <p>One example of a greedy algorithm is the "coin change" problem, where
          the goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain
          amount of change. The greedy approach would involve selecting the largest
          denomination coin at each step until the desired amount is reached. However,
          this approach may not always yield the optimal solution, as there may be
          cases where a combination of smaller coins would result in fewer total
          coins.</p>
        <p>Overall, greedy algorithms can be a useful tool for solving certain types
          of problems efficiently, but they may not always provide the optimal solution.
          It is important to carefully analyze the problem and consider alternative
          approaches when using greedy algorithms.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Greedy(a, n) {

        <h2 style="margin-left:auto;">Greedy algorithms have a wide range of applications in various fields. Here are some common examples:</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree</strong>: Greedy algorithms like Kruskal's
          algorithm and Prim's algorithm are used to find the minimum spanning tree
          in a graph. These algorithms iteratively select edges with the minimum
          weight to construct a tree that spans all the vertices.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Shortest Path</strong>: Algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and
          Bellman-Ford algorithm use a greedy approach to find the shortest path
          between two vertices in a graph. They iteratively select the vertex with
          the minimum distance and update the distances of its neighboring vertices.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Huffman Coding</strong>: Huffman coding is a lossless data compression
          algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their
          frequency of occurrence. It uses a greedy approach to construct an optimal
          prefix code, where the most frequent characters have the shortest codes.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Interval Scheduling</strong>: Greedy algorithms are used to solve
            interval scheduling problems, where the goal is to select the maximum number
            of non-overlapping intervals. The algorithm sorts the intervals based on
            their end times and greedily selects the intervals that do not overlap.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Knapsack Problem</strong>: In the fractional knapsack problem,
              where items can be divided, a greedy algorithm can be used to select items
              with the maximum value-to-weight ratio until the knapsack is full. However,
              for the 0/1 knapsack problem, where items cannot be divided, a greedy approach
              does not always yield the optimal solution.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:auto;"><strong>Job Scheduling</strong>: Greedy algorithms are used in job scheduling
                problems, where the goal is to schedule a set of jobs on limited resources.
                Algorithms like the earliest deadline first (EDF) and shortest job next
                (SJN) use a greedy approach to prioritize jobs based on their deadlines
                or execution times.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:auto;">These are just a few examples of how greedy algorithms can be applied.
                Greedy approaches are often used when the problem exhibits the greedy-choice
                property, meaning that making locally optimal choices leads to a globally
                optimal solution. However, it's important to note that greedy algorithms
                may not always provide the optimal solution for every problem.</p>
