       <h1>0/1 Knapsack Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer
          science and mathematics. It involves selecting a subset of items from a
          given set, each with its own weight and value, to maximize the total value
          while keeping the total weight within a given capacity.</p>
        <p>Here's a high-level overview of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Given a set of items, each with a weight and value, and a knapsack with
            a maximum weight capacity.</li>
          <li>The goal is to select a subset of items to maximize the total value while
            ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity.</li>
          <li>Each item can either be included (1) or excluded (0) in the knapsack.
            Hence, it is called the 0/1 Knapsack Problem because each item has a binary
            choice.</li>
          <li>The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where a table is
            constructed to store the maximum value that can be achieved for different
            subproblems.</li>
          <li>The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, considering each item and each
            possible weight capacity.</li>
          <li>The final entry in the table represents the maximum value that can be
            achieved with the given items and knapsack capacity.</li>
        </ol>
