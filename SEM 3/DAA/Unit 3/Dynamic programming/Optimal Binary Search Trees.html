       <h1>Optimal Binary Search Trees</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Optimal Binary Search Trees (OBSTs) are binary search trees that minimize
          the average search time for a given set of keys. In a binary search tree,
          each node has a key, and the keys in the left subtree are smaller than
          the key in the node, while the keys in the right subtree are greater.</p>
        <p>An optimal binary search tree is constructed based on the frequency or
          probability of accessing each key. The goal is to arrange the keys in a
          way that minimizes the expected search time. The expected search time is
          the weighted average of the search times for each key, where the weights
          are the frequencies or probabilities.</p>
        <p>The construction of an optimal binary search tree involves dynamic programming.
          The algorithm builds a table that stores the optimal search cost for each
          subproblem. It starts with the smallest subproblems (single keys) and gradually
          builds up to the larger subproblems (subsets of keys).</p>
        <p>The algorithm considers all possible subtrees and calculates the cost
          of each subtree based on the probabilities or frequencies. It then selects
          the subtree with the minimum cost and stores it in the table. This process
          is repeated until the optimal binary search tree for the entire set of
          keys is constructed.</p>
        <p>Once the optimal binary search tree is constructed, it can be used to
          efficiently search for keys. The expected search time for a key in an optimal
          binary search tree is minimized compared to other possible binary search
          trees.</p>
