        <p>the <strong>capacity</strong> of a flow graph is the amount of flow that
          can be transferred from one arc to another. The capacity function is used
          to calculate the maximum flow in a flow network</p>

        <p>"<strong>flow</strong>" refers to the quantity of material, data, or some
          other resource that is being transported through a network</p>
        <p>An <strong>augmenting</strong> path in the context of the Ford-Fulkerson
          algorithm is a path from the source node to the sink node in a flow network,
          along which the flow can be increased. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm works
          by iteratively finding augmenting paths and increasing the flow along those
          paths until no more augmenting paths can be found</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Extra:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The classic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, as originally formulated, is designed
          for finding the maximum flow in a network with a single source and a single
          sink. The algorithm iteratively finds augmenting paths from the source
          to the sink and increases the flow along these paths until no more augmenting
          paths can be found.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">However, if you have a network with multiple sources and sinks, the Ford-Fulkerson
          algorithm can still be applied with some modifications. One common approach
          is to introduce a new supersource and supersink. Connect all original sources
          to the supersource and all original sinks to the supersink with edges of
          infinite capacity. Then, apply the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to this modified
          network.</p>
