       <h1>Algorithm</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a popular method used to solve network
          flow problems, such as finding the maximum flow in a flow network. Here's
          a basic outline of the algorithm:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Initialize Flow</strong>: Set the flow in the network to be 0
          for all edges.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Find Augmenting Path</strong>: Search for an augmenting path from
          the source (S) to the sink (T) in the residual graph. The residual graph
          is created from the original graph by considering the residual capacity
          (original capacity minus flow) of each edge. This can be done using a depth-first
          search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Check for Termination</strong>: If no augmenting path is found,
          the algorithm terminates, as no more flow can be added.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Augment Flow</strong>: If an augmenting path is found, increase
          the flow along this path. The amount by which the flow can be increased
          is determined by the minimum residual capacity of the edges in the augmenting
          path.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Update Residual Graph</strong>: After augmenting the flow, update
          the residual capacities of the edges in the path. This involves decreasing
          the residual capacity of all forward edges (edges in the direction of the
          path) by the flow added and increasing the residual capacity of all backward
          edges (edges in the opposite direction of the path) by the same amount.
          This reflects the new possibilities of sending flow back as part of future
          augmentations.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Repeat</strong>: Return to step 2 and repeat the process until
          no more augmenting paths can be found.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Output Maximum Flow</strong>: The maximum flow in the network
          is the total flow at the sink (or equivalently, the total flow leaving
          the source).</p>
