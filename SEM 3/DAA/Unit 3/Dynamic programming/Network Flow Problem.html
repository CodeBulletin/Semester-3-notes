       <h1>Network Flow Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Network Flow Problem is a classic optimization problem that involves
          finding the maximum flow that can be sent through a network from a source
          node to a sink node. It models the flow of a commodity, such as water or
          data, through a network of interconnected nodes and edges.</p>
        <p>In this problem, the network is represented as a directed graph, where
          each edge has a capacity that represents the maximum amount of flow that
          can pass through it. The source node is the node where the flow originates,
          and the sink node is the node where the flow is intended to reach.</p>
        <p>The goal is to determine the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from
          the source to the sink while respecting the capacity constraints of the
          edges. The flow must also satisfy the conservation of flow principle, which
          states that the total flow entering a node (excluding the source and sink)
          must equal the total flow leaving that node.</p>
        <p>To solve the Network Flow Problem, various algorithms can be used, with
          the most well-known being the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and its variants,
          such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm and the Dinic's algorithm. These algorithms
          iteratively find augmenting paths in the residual graph, which is a modified
          version of the original graph that reflects the remaining capacity of the
          edges.</p>
        <p>The time complexity of solving the Network Flow Problem depends on the
          chosen algorithm. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm has a worst-case time complexity
          of O(EF), where E is the number of edges and F is the maximum flow value.
          However, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm and Dinic's algorithm have better time
          complexities of O(VE^2) and O(V^2E), respectively, where V is the number
          of vertices.</p>
