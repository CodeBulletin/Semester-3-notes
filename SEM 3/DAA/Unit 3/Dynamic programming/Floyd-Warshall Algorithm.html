       <h1>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a graph algorithm used to find the shortest
          paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It can handle
          both positive and negative edge weights, but it does not work with graphs
          that contain negative cycles.</p>
        <p>The algorithm works by iteratively considering all possible intermediate
          vertices in the paths between any two vertices. It builds a matrix called
          the "distance matrix" that stores the shortest distances between pairs
          of vertices. Initially, the distance matrix is filled with the weights
          of the edges in the graph.</p>
        <p>Then, for each vertex in the graph, the algorithm considers it as a possible
          intermediate vertex in the paths between all pairs of vertices. If the
          path through this intermediate vertex is shorter than the current shortest
          path, the distance matrix is updated accordingly.</p>
        <p>By repeating this process for all vertices, the algorithm gradually computes
          the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. At the end, the distance
          matrix contains the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices, and
          it can be used to reconstruct the actual paths if needed.</p>
