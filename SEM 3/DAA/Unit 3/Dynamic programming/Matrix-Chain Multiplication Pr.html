       <h1>Matrix-Chain Multiplication Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Matrix Chain Multiplication problem is a classic optimization problem
          in computer science. It involves finding the most efficient way to multiply
          a chain of matrices.</p>
        <p>Given a sequence of matrices, the goal is to determine the order of multiplication
          that minimizes the total number of scalar multiplications required. The
          order of multiplication is important because matrix multiplication is not
          commutative, meaning the product of matrices A and B is not necessarily
          the same as the product of matrices B and A.</p>
        <p>For example, given matrices A, B, C, and D, the order of multiplication
          can be represented as (A(BC))D or ((AB)C)D. The goal is to find the order
          that requires the fewest scalar multiplications.</p>
        <p>The Matrix Chain Multiplication problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
          The key idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and
          build up to the optimal solution.</p>
        <p>The dynamic programming approach involves constructing a table, often
          referred to as a matrix chain order table, to store the optimal costs of
          multiplying different subchains of matrices. By filling in this table using
          bottom-up computation, the optimal order of multiplication and the minimum
          number of scalar multiplications can be determined.</p>
        <p>The time complexity of solving the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem
          using dynamic programming is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(n^3)\)</span>,
          where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is the number of matrices
          in the chain. This makes it an efficient approach for solving the problem.</p>
        <p>The Matrix Chain Multiplication problem has applications in various fields,
          including computer graphics, optimization, and algorithm design. It is
          a classic example of how dynamic programming can be used to solve optimization
          problems efficiently.</p>
