       <h1>Longest Common Subsequence Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic computer science
          problem that involves finding the longest subsequence that two sequences
          have in common. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another
          sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of
          the remaining elements.</p>
        <p>In the LCS problem, given two sequences, the goal is to find the longest
          subsequence that is common to both sequences. This subsequence does not
          have to be contiguous, meaning the elements can be non-adjacent in the
          original sequences.</p>
        <p>The LCS problem has applications in various fields, such as bioinformatics,
          data comparison, and version control systems. It can be solved using dynamic
          programming techniques, where the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems
          and their solutions are combined to find the overall solution.</p>
