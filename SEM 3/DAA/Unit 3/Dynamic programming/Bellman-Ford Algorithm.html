       <h1>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest
          paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted directed
          graph. It can handle graphs with negative edge weights, unlike some other
          shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
        <p>Here's a high-level overview of the Bellman-Ford algorithm:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Initialize the distance of the source vertex to 0 and the distance of
            all other vertices to infinity.</li>
          <li>Relax each edge in the graph |V| - 1 times, where |V| is the number of
            vertices in the graph. During each relaxation, update the distance of the
            destination vertex if a shorter path is found.</li>
          <li>After |V| - 1 iterations, check for negative-weight cycles. If a shorter
            path is found during the |V|th iteration, then there is a negative-weight
            cycle in the graph.</li>
          <li>If there are no negative-weight cycles, the algorithm has found the shortest
            paths from the source vertex to all other vertices.</li>
        </ol>
