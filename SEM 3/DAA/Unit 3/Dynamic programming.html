       <h1>Dynamic programming</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Dynamic programming is a problem-solving technique used in computer science
          and mathematics to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller
          overlapping subproblems. It is particularly useful for optimization problems
          where the solution can be expressed as the optimal solution to a sequence
          of smaller subproblems.</p>
        <p>The key idea behind dynamic programming is to solve each subproblem only
          once and store its solution in a table or memoization array. This way,
          when the same subproblem is encountered again, its solution can be retrieved
          in constant time, rather than recomputing it.</p>
        <p>Dynamic programming typically involves three steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Characterizing the structure of an optimal solution</strong>:
            This involves identifying the subproblems and defining the relationship
            between the optimal solution of the original problem and the optimal solutions
            of its subproblems.</li>
          <li><strong>Defining the value of an optimal solution recursively</strong>:
            This step involves formulating a recursive equation that expresses the
            value of an optimal solution in terms of the values of smaller subproblems.</li>
          <li><strong>Computing the value of an optimal solution</strong>: This is done
            by solving the subproblems in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest
            subproblems and gradually building up to the solution of the original problem.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Dynamic programming is known for its efficiency and ability to solve problems
          that would otherwise be computationally infeasible. It is widely used in
          various fields, including computer science, operations research, economics,
          and bioinformatics, to name a few.</p>
        <h2>Principal of Optimality</h2>
        <p>The Principle of Optimality, also known as Bellman's Principle of Optimality,
          is a fundamental concept in dynamic programming. It states that an optimal
          solution to a problem exhibits the property that every subpath of the solution
          is also an optimal solution to its respective subproblem.</p>
        <p>In simpler terms, the principle states that if a solution to a larger
          problem can be divided into smaller subproblems, then the optimal solution
          to the larger problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of
          the smaller subproblems.</p>
        <p>This principle is crucial in dynamic programming because it allows us
          to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving
          them independently. By solving the subproblems optimally, we can then combine
          their solutions to obtain the optimal solution to the original problem.</p>
        <p>The Principle of Optimality helps in avoiding redundant computations by
          storing the solutions to subproblems in a table or memoization array. This
          way, when a subproblem is encountered again, its solution can be retrieved
          in constant time, rather than recomputing it.</p>
        <p>Overall, the Principle of Optimality is a guiding principle in dynamic
          programming that enables us to solve complex problems efficiently by exploiting
          the optimal substructure property.</p>
