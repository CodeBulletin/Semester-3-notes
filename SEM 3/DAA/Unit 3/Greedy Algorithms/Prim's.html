        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Prim's algorithm is another greedy algorithm used to find the minimum
          spanning tree (MST) of a connected, weighted graph. It starts with an arbitrary
          vertex and iteratively adds the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex
          in the MST to a vertex outside the MST, until all vertices are included
          in the MST.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a step-by-step explanation of Prim's algorithm:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Choose an arbitrary vertex to start the MST.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a set to store the vertices included in the MST and initialize
            it with the chosen vertex.</li>
          <li>Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store the edges connected to the
            vertices in the MST. The priority of each edge is its weight.</li>
          <li>While the priority queue is not empty:</li>
          <li>Remove the edge with the minimum weight from the priority queue.
            <ul>
              <li>If the edge connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST:
                <ul>
                  <li>Add the edge to the MST.</li>
                  <li>Add the vertex outside the MST to the set of included vertices.</li>
                  <li>Add all edges connected to the newly added vertex to the priority queue.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Continue this process until all vertices are included in the MST.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The resulting set of edges forms the minimum spanning tree of the graph.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Prim's algorithm ensures that at each step, the edge with the minimum
          weight is selected and added to the MST. This guarantees that the MST is
          formed with the minimum total weight.</p>
