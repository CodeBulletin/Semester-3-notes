       <h1>Kruskal&#39;s</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning
          tree (MST) of a connected, weighted graph. The algorithm starts with an
          empty set of edges and iteratively adds edges in increasing order of their
          weights, while ensuring that no cycles are formed. When all vertices are
          connected, the algorithm terminates, and the resulting set of edges forms
          the MST.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a step-by-step explanation of Kruskal's algorithm:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sort the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.</li>
          <li>Create an empty set to hold the MST.</li>
          <li>Iterate through the sorted edges. For each edge:
            <ul>
              <li>If adding the edge to the MST does not create a cycle, i.e., the two endpoints
                of the edge are not already connected in the MST, add the edge to the MST.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Continue this process until all vertices are connected or there are no
            more edges to consider.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The algorithm typically uses a disjoint-set data structure to efficiently
          check for cycles and maintain the connectivity of vertices. The disjoint-set
          data structure keeps track of disjoint sets of vertices and allows efficient
          operations such as union and find.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Once the algorithm terminates, the set of edges obtained forms the minimum
          spanning tree of the graph.</p>
