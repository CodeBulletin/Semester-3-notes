       <h1>Dijikstra&#39;s</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest
          path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with
          non-negative edge weights. It was developed by Dutch computer scientist
          Edsger Dijkstra in 1956.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The algorithm works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Initialize the graph: Start by initializing the graph with all vertices
            and edges. Assign a tentative distance value to every vertex. Set the distance
            of the source vertex to 0 and the distance of all other vertices to infinity.</li>
          <li>Select the vertex with the minimum distance: Choose the vertex with the
            smallest tentative distance as the current vertex and mark it as visited.</li>
          <li>Explore neighboring vertices: For the current vertex, consider all of
            its neighboring vertices (vertices directly connected to it by an edge)
            that have not been visited. Calculate the tentative distance from the source
            vertex to each neighboring vertex by summing the distance to the current
            vertex and the weight of the edge connecting them.</li>
          <li>Update distances: If the newly calculated tentative distance is smaller
            than the current assigned distance, update the distance of the neighboring
            vertex. This step aims to keep track of the shortest known distance to
            each vertex.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 2-4: Repeat steps 2-4 until all vertices have been visited
            or until the destination vertex has been reached.</li>
          <li>Termination: Once all vertices have been visited or the destination vertex
            has been reached, the algorithm terminates. The resulting distances represent
            the shortest path from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Additionally, Dijkstra's algorithm can keep track of the actual path by
          maintaining a "previous" array, which stores the preceding vertex on the
          shortest path to each vertex. By backtracking from the destination vertex
          to the source vertex using this array, the shortest path can be reconstructed.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees finding the shortest path in a graph with
          non-negative edge weights, and it is widely used in various applications
          such as network routing, GPS navigation, and optimizing resource allocation.</p>
