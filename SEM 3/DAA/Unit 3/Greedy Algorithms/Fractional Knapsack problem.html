       <h1>Fractional Knapsack problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Fractional Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that
          involves selecting items with maximum total value to fit into a knapsack
          with a limited capacity. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack problem, in the Fractional
          Knapsack problem, items can be divided (fractional) to maximize the total
          value.</p>
        <p>Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the Fractional Knapsack problem:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item by dividing the value
            of the item by its weight.</li>
          <li>Sort the items in descending order based on their value-to-weight ratio.</li>
          <li>Initialize the total value and remaining capacity of the knapsack to 0.</li>
          <li>Iterate through the sorted items and do the following:
            <ul>
              <li>If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the remaining
                capacity of the knapsack, add the entire item to the knapsack. Update the
                total value and remaining capacity accordingly.</li>
              <li>If the weight of the current item is greater than the remaining capacity,
                add a fraction of the item to the knapsack to fill the remaining capacity.
                Update the total value and remaining capacity accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Return the total value as the maximum achievable value.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The time complexity of this algorithm is dominated by the sorting step,
          which is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(n \space log \space ‚Å°n)\)</span>,
          where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is the number of items.</p>
