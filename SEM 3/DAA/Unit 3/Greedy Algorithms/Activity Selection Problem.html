       <h1>Activity Selection Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Activity Selection Problem is a classic optimization problem that
          involves selecting a maximum-size set of non-overlapping activities from
          a given set of activities, each with a start time and an end time. The
          goal is to find the maximum number of activities that can be performed
          without any conflicts.</p>
        <p>Here's a formal description of the problem:</p>
        <p>Given a set of n activities, each represented by a pair (start time, end
          time), the task is to select the maximum number of activities that can
          be performed, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity
          at a time. Two activities are considered compatible if their time intervals
          do not overlap.</p>
        <p>The Activity Selection Problem can be efficiently solved using a greedy
          algorithm. The algorithm follows these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sort the activities based on their end times in ascending order.</li>
          <li>Select the first activity with the earliest end time and add it to the
            selected set.</li>
          <li>For each subsequent activity, if its start time is greater than or equal
            to the end time of the previously selected activity, add it to the selected
            set.</li>
          <li>Repeat step 3 until all activities have been considered.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The greedy approach works because selecting the activity with the earliest
          end time leaves more room for selecting other activities. By always choosing
          the activity that finishes first, we maximize the number of activities
          that can be performed.</p>
        <p>The time complexity of the greedy algorithm for the Activity Selection
          Problem is O(n log n), where n is the number of activities. This is due
          to the initial sorting step. The selection process itself takes linear
          time.</p>
        <p>The Activity Selection Problem has various real-world applications, such
          as scheduling tasks, job sequencing, classroom scheduling, and resource
          allocation.</p>
