       <h1>Huffman Coding</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length
          codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the input
          data. It is widely used in various applications, including file compression,
          data transmission, and encryption.</p>
        <p>Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Huffman coding works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.</li>
          <li>Create a priority queue (min-heap) of nodes, where each node represents
            a character and its frequency.</li>
          <li>Initialize the priority queue with the nodes corresponding to the characters
            and their frequencies.</li>
          <li>While there is more than one node in the priority queue:
            <ul>
              <li>Remove the two nodes with the lowest frequencies from the priority queue.</li>
              <li>Create a new node with a frequency equal to the sum of the frequencies
                of the two removed nodes. Make the two removed nodes its left and right
                children.</li>
              <li>Insert the new node back into the priority queue.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The remaining node in the priority queue is the root of the Huffman tree.</li>
          <li>Traverse the Huffman tree from the root, assigning a '0' to the left child
            and a '1' to the right child at each step.</li>
          <li>Assign the resulting binary codes to the corresponding characters.</li>
          <li>Encode the input data using the generated Huffman codes.</li>
          <li>Decode the encoded data using the Huffman tree.</li>
        </ol>
