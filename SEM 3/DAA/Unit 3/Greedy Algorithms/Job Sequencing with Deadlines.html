       <h1>Job Sequencing with Deadlines </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:auto;">The Job Sequencing with Deadlines problem is another classic optimization
          problem that involves scheduling a set of jobs with associated profits
          and deadlines to maximize the total profit. Each job has a specific deadline
          by which it needs to be completed, and only one job can be scheduled at
          a time also one job requires 1 unit of time.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:auto;">Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the Job Sequencing with Deadlines
          problem:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sort the jobs in descending order based on their profits.</li>
          <li>Initialize an array or list to keep track of the time slots. Each time
            slot represents a specific deadline.</li>
          <li>Iterate through the sorted jobs and do the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Starting from the job's deadline, find the first available time slot (i.e.,
                a time slot that is not yet occupied).</li>
              <li>If a time slot is available, assign the job to that time slot and mark
                it as occupied.</li>
              <li>If no time slot is available, skip the job (as it cannot be scheduled
                within its deadline).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Calculate the total profit by summing up the profits of the scheduled
            jobs.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Where,</p>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;"><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is number of jobs</p>
        <p style="margin-left:40px;"><span class="math-tex">\(d\)</span>&nbsp;is maximum deadline</p>
