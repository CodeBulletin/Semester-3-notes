       <h1>time complexity</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The time complexity of the Branch and Bound algorithm for the assignment
          problem can vary significantly based on the specific instance of the problem
          and the efficiency of the bounding technique used. However, in the worst
          case, the time complexity can be exponential, specifically O(n!)O(n!).</p>
        <p>Here's why:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Branching</strong>: In the worst case, each level of the recursion
            tree corresponds to assigning one of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;items
            to a task. For the first item, there are&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;choices,
            for the second item, there are&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n-1\)</span>&nbsp;choices,
            and so on, down to&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>&nbsp;choice
            for the last item.</li>
          <li><strong>Bounding</strong>: The bounding step helps to prune the search
            space. However, in the worst case, where bounding does not effectively
            reduce the number of branches to be explored, the algorithm will need to
            examine almost every possible permutation of assignments.</li>
          <li><strong>Recursion Depth</strong>: The depth of the recursive call stack
            will be&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>, as each level of recursion
            corresponds to an assignment for one of the&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;items.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, the time complexity is&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(O(n!)\)</span>, as the algorithm potentially explores all permutations
            of assignments. However, with effective bounding, the practical runtime
            for many instances can be significantly lower than this worst-case bound.</p>
