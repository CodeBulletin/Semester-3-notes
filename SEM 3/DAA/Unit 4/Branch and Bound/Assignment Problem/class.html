        <p>The Assignment Problem, a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization,
          typically falls into the complexity class known as "P." This means it can
          be solved in polynomial time, which is a relatively efficient class in
          terms of computational complexity.</p>
        <p>More specifically, the Assignment Problem can be efficiently solved using
          algorithms like the Hungarian Method or other polynomial-time algorithms.
          These methods ensure that the problem, which involves assigning tasks to
          agents in a way that minimizes the total cost or maximizes the total efficiency,
          can be solved in a time frame that grows polynomially with the size of
          the input.</p>
