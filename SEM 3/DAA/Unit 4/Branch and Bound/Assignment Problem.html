       <h1>Assignment Problem </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Assignment Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in the
          field of operations research and computer science. It can be described
          as follows: given a set of tasks and a set of agents (workers), where each
          agent has a certain cost or efficiency associated with performing each
          task, the goal is to find the most efficient assignment of tasks to agents,
          such that the total cost or time is minimized.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here are the key components of the Assignment Problem:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Tasks:</strong> A set of tasks that need to be completed. Each
          task must be assigned to exactly one agent.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Agents:</strong> A set of agents or workers available to perform
          the tasks. Each agent can be assigned to at most one task.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Costs or Efficiencies:</strong> A cost or efficiency measure associated
          with assigning a particular agent to a specific task. The objective is
          usually to minimize the total cost or maximize the total efficiency.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The Assignment Problem can be mathematically formulated as an optimization
          problem. Let&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(C\)</span>&nbsp;be a matrix
          representing the costs or efficiencies, where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(C[i][j]\)</span>&nbsp;is
          the cost of assigning agent&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span>&nbsp;to
          task&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(j\)</span>&nbsp;The goal is to find
          a permutation matrix&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span>&nbsp;(a binary
          matrix that has exactly one 1 in each row and each column) that minimizes
          the objective function:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Minimize&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\sum_{i, j}C[i][j]P[i][j]\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">subject to the constraints that each row and each column of&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(P\)</span>&nbsp;contains exactly one 1.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are efficient algorithms to solve the Assignment Problem, such as
            the Hungarian algorithm. The problem has applications in various fields,
            including logistics, scheduling, and resource allocation.</p>
