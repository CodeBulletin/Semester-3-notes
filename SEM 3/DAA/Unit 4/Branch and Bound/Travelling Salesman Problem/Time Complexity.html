       <h1>Time Complexity</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The time complexity of the provided code is O(n!), where n is the number
          of vertices in the graph.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's why:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">The code generates all permutations of the vertices (excluding the source
            vertex). The number of permutations of n items is n!, hence the O(n!) time
            complexity.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;">For each permutation, the code calculates the total weight of the path.
            This operation is O(n) for each permutation, but since it's done for each
            of the n! permutations, it doesn't change the overall time complexity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">So, the overall time complexity remains O(n!). This is quite high, so
          this approach is only suitable for small graphs. For larger graphs, a more
          efficient algorithm would be needed.</p>
