       <h1>Backtracking</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Backtracking is a systematic method for generating all (or some) possible
          configurations of a given problem. It's widely used in the design and analysis
          of algorithms. The key features of backtracking include:</p>
        <p><strong>Recursive Approach</strong>: Backtracking is typically implemented
          using recursion, where the algorithm explores each possibility until it
          finds a solution or concludes that no solution exists.</p>
        <p><strong>State Space Tree</strong>: The set of all possible states of the
          problem forms a state space tree. Each node represents a partial solution.
          The root is an initial state, and the leaves are final states (solutions
          or failures).</p>
        <p><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong>: Backtracking algorithms perform
          a depth-first search of the state space tree, exploring one branch to its
          fullest before backtracking and trying another.</p>
        <p><strong>Pruning</strong>: The algorithm prunes branches from the tree
          as soon as it determines they cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.
          This pruning is based on constraints and conditions defined for the problem,
          making backtracking more efficient than a naive brute-force approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications</strong>: Backtracking is used in various problems
          like solving puzzles (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens), combinatorial problems (e.g.,
          generating permutations, subsets), and in some cases, optimization problems.</p>
        <p><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: The time complexity of backtracking
          algorithms can be high because they might explore the entire solution space
          in the worst case. However, effective pruning can significantly reduce
          the number of configurations that need to be examined.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">function backtrack(State current_state):

        <p>In this pseudo code:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>is_solution</strong>: This function checks whether the current
            state is a solution to the problem.</li>
          <li><strong>report_solution</strong>: If a solution is found, this function
            processes or prints the solution.</li>
          <li><strong>available_options</strong>: This function generates all possible
            options or moves from the current state.</li>
          <li><strong>is_valid</strong>: This function checks whether an option is valid
            under the problem constraints.</li>
          <li><strong>apply_option</strong>: This function modifies the current state
            by applying an option.</li>
          <li><strong>undo_option</strong>: After backtracking, this function undoes
            the changes made by the last applied option.</li>
          <li><strong>setup_initial_conditions</strong>: This sets up the initial state
            of the problem.</li>
