       <h1>Introduction to Computability</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Computability theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the
          study of what can and cannot be computed by various computational models.
          It explores the fundamental limits of computation and seeks to understand
          the notion of computability.</p>
        <p>At its core, computability theory investigates the concept of an algorithm
          or a computational procedure. It aims to answer questions such as: What
          problems can be solved by an algorithm? Are there problems that cannot
          be solved by any algorithm? How can we determine if a problem is solvable
          or not?</p>
        <p>One of the central figures in the development of computability theory
          is Alan Turing, who introduced the concept of a Turing machine in the 1930s.
          A Turing machine is a theoretical model of a computing device that can
          simulate any algorithmic process. Turing's work laid the foundation for
          understanding the limits of computation and the notion of undecidability.</p>
        <p>A key concept in computability theory is the notion of a decision problem.
          A decision problem is a yes-or-no question that can be answered by an algorithm.
          For example, given a list of numbers, is there a pair of numbers that adds
          up to a specific target value? The question of whether a decision problem
          is solvable by an algorithm is closely related to the concept of computability.</p>
        <p>Computability theory also explores the concept of reducibility, which
          is a way to compare the computational difficulty of different problems.
          If one problem can be reduced to another, it means that the solution to
          the second problem can be used to solve the first problem. This notion
          helps in classifying problems based on their computational complexity.</p>
        <p>In summary, <strong>computability theory is concerned with understanding the fundamental limits of computation and the concept of computability. It explores the capabilities and limitations of computational models and provides insights into what can and cannot be computed. This field has had a profound impact on computer science and has paved the way for the development of algorithms, programming languages, and the theory of computation.</strong>
