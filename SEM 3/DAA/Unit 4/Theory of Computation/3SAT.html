        <p style="margin-left:0px;">3-SAT, or 3-satisfiability, is a well-known problem in computer science
          and mathematics that belongs to the class of Boolean satisfiability problems
          (SAT). In the 3-SAT problem, you are given a Boolean formula in conjunctive
          normal form (CNF), which is a logical expression consisting of clauses,
          each of which is a disjunction of three literals (variables or their negations).</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a more detailed explanation:</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Boolean Variables:</strong> In 3-SAT, you have a set of Boolean
              variables, often denoted as x1, x2, x3, and so on.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Clauses:</strong> The given Boolean formula consists of multiple
              clauses, each of which is a disjunction (OR) of exactly three literals.
              A literal is either a Boolean variable (e.g., x1) or its negation (e.g.,
              Â¬x2).</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal is to determine whether there exists an
              assignment of values (true or false) to the Boolean variables that makes
              the entire formula true. In other words, you need to find an assignment
              that satisfies all the clauses in the CNF.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The 3-SAT problem is a well-known NP-complete problem, which means that
            it is computationally difficult to solve in the general case, and it is
            at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP (nondeterministic polynomial
            time). This complexity class includes many optimization and decision problems,
            and 3-SAT is used to prove the NP-completeness of various other problems,
            demonstrating their computational difficulty.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Efficient algorithms for solving 3-SAT are not known, and it is widely
            believed that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can solve it for
            all instances, given the NP-completeness of the problem.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Theoretical computer science often uses 3-SAT as a benchmark problem for
            studying the complexity of algorithms and as a basis for proving computational
            hardness results.</p>
