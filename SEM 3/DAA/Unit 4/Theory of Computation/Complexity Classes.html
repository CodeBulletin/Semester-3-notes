       <h1>Complexity Classes</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>There are several different complexity classes in computational complexity
          theory, each representing a different level of computational difficulty.
          Here are some of the most commonly studied complexity classes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>P (Polynomial Time)</strong>: P is the class of decision problems
            that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
            These are problems that have efficient algorithms for their solution.</li>
          <li><strong>NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)</strong>: NP is the class
            of decision problems that can be verified in polynomial time. While finding
            a solution to an NP problem may be difficult, given a potential solution,
            it can be efficiently verified. The question of whether P = NP, i.e., whether
            every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time, is one of the most
            important open problems in computer science.</li>
          <li><strong>NP-complete</strong>: NP-complete is a subset of NP problems that
            are considered to be among the most difficult problems in NP. A problem
            is NP-complete if every other problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial
            time. If a polynomial-time algorithm is found for any NP-complete problem,
            it would imply that P = NP.</li>
          <li><strong>NP-hard</strong>: NP-hard is a class of problems that are at least
            as difficult as the NP-complete problems. While NP-complete problems are
            a subset of NP-hard problems, NP-hard problems may or may not be in NP.
            They represent problems that are computationally challenging and do not
            necessarily have efficient solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>EXP (Exponential Time)</strong>: EXP is the class of decision
            problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in exponential
            time. These problems have solutions that require an exponential amount
            of time to compute.</li>
          <li><strong>PSPACE (Polynomial Space)</strong>: PSPACE is the class of decision
            problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial
            amount of memory space. It represents problems that can be solved with
            a reasonable amount of memory.</li>
          <li><strong>BPP (Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial Time)</strong>: BPP
            is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a probabilistic
            Turing machine in polynomial time with a bounded probability of error.
            These problems can be solved with a randomized algorithm that produces
            the correct answer with high probability.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are just a few examples of complexity classes, and there are many
          more, each representing different levels of computational difficulty. The
          study of complexity classes helps in understanding the inherent complexity
          of computational problems and provides insights into the limits of efficient
          computation.</p>
