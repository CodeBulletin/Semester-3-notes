        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove that 3-CNF-SAT (3-Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability) is
          NP-complete, we follow a similar approach as with CNF-SAT, but with a specific
          focus on the 3-CNF format. In 3-CNF, each clause in the formula has exactly
          three literals. The two main steps are:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Show that 3-CNF-SAT is in NP:</strong> This involves demonstrating
          that any solution to a 3-CNF-SAT problem can be verified in polynomial
          time.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Show that 3-CNF-SAT is NP-hard:</strong> This is typically done
          by reducing a known NP-complete problem (like SAT or CNF-SAT) to 3-CNF-SAT
          in polynomial time.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. 3-CNF-SAT is in NP</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove that 3-CNF-SAT is in NP, we need to demonstrate that given a
          particular assignment of variables, we can verify whether this assignment
          satisfies the 3-CNF formula in polynomial time. Since a 3-CNF formula is
          just a special case of a CNF formula where each clause has exactly three
          literals, the verification process is similar. We check each clause to
          see if at least one literal is true. This can be done in polynomial time,
          hence 3-CNF-SAT is in NP.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. 3-CNF-SAT is NP-hard</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The more challenging part is proving that 3-CNF-SAT is NP-hard. This is
          done by reducing an already known NP-complete problem to 3-CNF-SAT. The
          standard approach is to use the SAT problem. We need to show that any instance
          of SAT can be polynomially transformed into an instance of 3-CNF-SAT that
          is satisfiable if and only if the original SAT instance is satisfiable.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a sketch of this reduction:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with a Boolean formula from the SAT problem.
              This formula might be in any form, not necessarily in CNF.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Convert this formula into CNF using standard logical
              equivalences.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Transform the CNF formula into a 3-CNF formula.
              This is the crucial step.</li>
          </ul>

          </figure>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">This transformation is done in such a way that the original formula is
            satisfiable if and only if the new 3-CNF formula is satisfiable. Moreover,
            this transformation can be achieved in polynomial time.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">By completing these steps, we've shown that any instance of SAT can be
            reduced to an instance of 3-CNF-SAT in polynomial time, and that verifying
            a solution to 3-CNF-SAT is possible in polynomial time. Therefore, 3-CNF-SAT
            is NP-complete. This proof is a cornerstone in computational complexity
            theory and has significant implications for understanding the computational
            difficulty of various problems in computer science.</p>
