        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove that the Clique problem is NP-complete, we can use a reduction
          from the 3-CNF SAT problem, which is already known to be NP-complete. The
          Clique problem involves determining whether a given graph contains a clique
          (a subset of vertices, all of which are connected to each other) of a certain
          size. Here's how the proof is structured:</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. Clique is in NP</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To show that the Clique problem is in NP, we need to demonstrate that
          given a set of vertices, we can verify in polynomial time whether it forms
          a clique of the required size. Verifying a clique involves checking if
          every pair of vertices in the set is connected by an edge, which can be
          done in polynomial time.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. Clique is NP-hard</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The more challenging part is proving that Clique is NP-hard. This is achieved
          by reducing the 3-CNF SAT problem to the Clique problem in polynomial time.
          The reduction goes as follows:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with an instance of 3-CNF SAT. This instance
          is a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form where each clause contains
          exactly three literals (variables or their negations).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Construct a graph for the Clique problem based
          on this 3-CNF formula. The graph is built using the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each clause in the 3-CNF formula, create a set of vertices in the
            graph, each representing a literal in the clause.</li>
          <li>Connect two vertices with an edge if and only if they belong to different
            clauses and they are not contradictory (i.e., one is not the negation of
            the other).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set the size of the clique to be searched for
          in the graph to the number of clauses in the 3-CNF formula.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Analyze the equivalence:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the 3-CNF formula is satisfiable, then there exists a truth assignment
            that satisfies all clauses. This corresponds to selecting one literal from
            each clause to be true. In the graph, this means there will be a clique
            of size equal to the number of clauses, as these literals do not contradict
            each other.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Conversely, if there is a clique of the required size in the graph, it
            means that there is a set of non-contradictory literals, one from each
            clause, which would satisfy the 3-CNF formula.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-left:0px;">This transformation can be done in polynomial time. Since we've transformed
          an instance of 3-CNF SAT (an NP-complete problem) into an instance of the
          Clique problem, and we can verify a solution to the Clique problem in polynomial
          time, it follows that the Clique problem is NP-complete.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">This proof is an important part of computational complexity theory, as
          it establishes the computational difficulty of finding cliques in graphs,
          a problem with many applications in computer science and network analysis.</p>
