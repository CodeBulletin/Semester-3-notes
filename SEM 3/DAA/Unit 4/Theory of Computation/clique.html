        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A clique is a fundamental concept in graph theory, representing a subset
          of vertices within an undirected graph that are all pairwise adjacent.
          In other words, in a clique, every vertex is directly connected to every
          other vertex within the subset.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Formally, a clique in an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a set of vertices
          C âŠ† V such that, for every pair of distinct vertices u and v in C, there
          is an edge (u, v) in E.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Clique Size: The size of a clique is defined as the number of vertices
          it contains. So, a clique of size "k" consists of "k" vertices where every
          possible pair of vertices within the subset is connected by an edge.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The maximum clique problem is a common optimization problem in graph theory,
          where the goal is to find the largest possible clique within a given graph.
          This problem is often denoted as Max-Clique and is known to be NP-hard,
          meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it exactly
          for all cases unless P = NP.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Finding the maximum clique in a graph can be computationally challenging,
            and various algorithms and heuristics have been developed to approximate
            the solution. These include techniques like branch-and-bound, greedy algorithms,
            and search algorithms.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Clique applications are diverse and can be found in areas such as social
            network analysis, biology (e.g., in the study of protein-protein interaction
            networks), and various optimization problems, including scheduling and
            resource allocation. The concept of cliques is also closely related to
            other graph theory concepts, like independent sets and vertex covers.</p>
