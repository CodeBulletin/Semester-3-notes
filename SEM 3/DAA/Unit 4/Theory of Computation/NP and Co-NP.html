      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time)</strong>: This class contains
          all decision problems for which the instances where the answer is "yes"
          have proofs that can be verified in polynomial time. This means that if
          the answer is "yes," there is some evidence or certificate (like a solution
          to a puzzle) that can be checked quickly.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Co-NP</strong>: This is the complementary class to NP. It contains
          all decision problems for which the instances where the answer is "no"
          have proofs verifiable in polynomial time. In other words, if the answer
          to a problem is "no," there is a quick method to verify that this is indeed
          the case.</p>
