       <h1>Proof</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove that CNF-SAT (Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability) is NP-complete,
          we typically follow two main steps:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Show that CNF-SAT is in NP:</strong> This means demonstrating that
          any proposed solution to a CNF-SAT problem can be checked quickly (in polynomial
          time).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Show that CNF-SAT is NP-hard:</strong> This involves proving that
          any problem in NP can be reduced to CNF-SAT in polynomial time. The standard
          approach is to use a known NP-complete problem, typically SAT (Satisfiability
          Problem), and show that it can be transformed into CNF-SAT.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Let's go through each step:</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. CNF-SAT is in NP</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To show that CNF-SAT is in NP, we need to demonstrate that given a particular
          assignment of variables, we can verify whether this assignment satisfies
          the CNF formula in polynomial time. A CNF formula is a conjunction (AND)
          of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals (a variable
          or its negation).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Given an assignment, we can check each clause by verifying if at least
          one literal in the clause evaluates to true. Since each literal can be
          checked in constant time and the number of literals in a formula is polynomial
          in the size of the formula, this process is polynomial in time. Therefore,
          CNF-SAT is in NP.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. CNF-SAT is NP-hard</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove NP-hardness, we use a reduction from the SAT problem, which is
          known to be NP-complete. SAT involves determining if there is an assignment
          of variables that satisfies a given Boolean formula. The goal is to transform
          any instance of SAT into an equivalent instance of CNF-SAT.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a sketch of how this transformation can work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take any Boolean formula from the SAT problem.
            This formula might not be in CNF.</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Convert this formula into CNF using standard logical
            equivalences (like De Morgan's laws and distribution laws). For example,
            we can transform expressions like&nbsp;
            <br><strong>(A AND B) OR C</strong> into an equivalent CNF form like&nbsp;
            <br><strong>(A OR C) AND (B OR C).</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">This transformation can be done in polynomial time. The resulting CNF
          formula is satisfiable if and only if the original SAT formula is satisfiable.
          Therefore, we have shown that any problem in SAT can be reduced to CNF-SAT
          in polynomial time.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Since we've shown that CNF-SAT is both in NP and NP-hard, it follows that
          CNF-SAT is NP-complete. This proof is significant because it not only establishes
          the computational complexity of CNF-SAT but also lays the groundwork for
          the NP-completeness of many other problems through further reductions.</p>
