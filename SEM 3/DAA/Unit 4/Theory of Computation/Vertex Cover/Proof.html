          <br>To prove that the Vertex Cover problem is NP-complete, we can use a reduction
          from the Clique problem, which is already known to be NP-complete. The
          Vertex Cover problem involves determining whether a given graph contains
          a vertex cover (a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident
          to at least one vertex in the set) of a certain size.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's the structure of the proof:</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. Vertex Cover is in NP</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To show that the Vertex Cover problem is in NP, we need to demonstrate
          that given a set of vertices, we can verify in polynomial time whether
          it forms a vertex cover of the required size. Verifying a vertex cover
          involves checking if each edge in the graph is incident to at least one
          vertex in the set, which can be done in polynomial time.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. Vertex Cover is NP-hard</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The more challenging part is proving that Vertex Cover is NP-hard. This
          is achieved by reducing the Clique problem to the Vertex Cover problem
          in polynomial time. The reduction goes as follows:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with an instance of the Clique problem,
          a graph&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;and an integer&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>, where the task is to find out if there's a clique of size&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Construct a new graph&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;based
          on&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;for the Vertex Cover problem.
          The graph&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;is the complement
          of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>, which means&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;contains
          all the edges that are not present in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;and
          vice versa.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set the size of the vertex cover to be searched
          for in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n-k\)</span>,
          where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is the number of vertices
          in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;(and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>).</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Analyze the equivalence:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If there is a clique of size&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;
              <span
              class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>, then there are&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;vertices
                all connected to each other. In&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>,
                these&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;vertices are not connected
                to each other, meaning the rest of the&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n-k\)</span>&nbsp;vertices
                must cover all edges in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>, forming
                a vertex cover.</li>
            <li>Conversely, if there is a vertex cover of size&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n-k\)</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;
              <span
              class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>, then the remaining&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;vertices
                form a clique in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>. This is because
                these&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>&nbsp;vertices are not part
                of the vertex cover, implying no edges between them are in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>,
                which means all edges between them are in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:0px;">This transformation can be done in polynomial time. Since we've transformed
            an instance of the Clique problem (an NP-complete problem) into an instance
            of the Vertex Cover problem, and we can verify a solution to the Vertex
            Cover problem in polynomial time, it follows that the Vertex Cover problem
            is NP-complete.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">This proof is significant in computational complexity and has practical
            implications in various fields such as network theory, where finding minimal
            vertex covers is a common problem.</p>
