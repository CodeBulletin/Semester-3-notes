        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. Hamiltonian Circuit is in NP</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To show that the Hamiltonian Circuit problem is in NP, we need to demonstrate
          that a given solution (a cycle in this case) can be verified in polynomial
          time. Given a sequence of vertices, we can check in polynomial time if
          it forms a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the
          starting vertex.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. Hamiltonian Circuit is NP-hard</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove NP-hardness, we need to reduce a known NP-complete problem to
          the Hamiltonian Circuit problem. We use the Hamiltonian Path problem for
          this reduction. Hereâ€™s how the reduction works:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take an instance of the Hamiltonian Path problem,
          represented by a graph&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a new graph&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;based
          on&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;for the Hamiltonian Circuit
          problem. To do this, add a new vertex&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(v'\)</span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;and connect&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(v'\)</span>&nbsp;to
            all vertices in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>. This forms the
            new graph&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Analyze the equivalence:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;has a Hamiltonian Path,
                then&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;will have a Hamiltonian
                Circuit. The path in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;can
                be extended to a circuit in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;by
                starting at&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(v'\)</span>, traversing the path
                in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>, and returning to&nbsp;
                <span
                class="math-tex">\(v'\)</span>.</li>
              <li>Conversely, if&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>&nbsp;has a Hamiltonian
                Circuit, then&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;must have a
                Hamiltonian Path. Since every vertex in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;is
                connected to&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(v'\)</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;
                <span
                class="math-tex">\(G'\)</span>, the circuit must pass through&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(v'\)</span>&nbsp;exactly
                  once, and the remaining part of the circuit forms a path in&nbsp;
                  <span
                  class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;that visits every vertex exactly once.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">This transformation can be done in polynomial time. Since we've shown
              that any instance of the Hamiltonian Path problem (an NP-complete problem)
              can be reduced to the Hamiltonian Circuit problem, and we can verify a
              solution to the Hamiltonian Circuit problem in polynomial time, it follows
              that the Hamiltonian Circuit problem is NP-complete.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">This proof highlights the computational complexity of finding a Hamiltonian
              Circuit in a graph, a fundamental problem with implications in various
              fields such as logistics, network design, and computational biology.</p>
