        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Cook's Theorem, named after the mathematician Stephen Cook, is a fundamental
          theorem in the field of computational complexity theory. Formulated in
          1971, this theorem established the concept of NP-completeness, which has
          since been a central topic in computer science. Here's a summary of what
          Cook's Theorem states and its significance:</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Statement of Cook's Theorem</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Cook's Theorem asserts that the Boolean satisfiability problem (often
          referred to as SAT) is NP-complete. In other words, SAT is at least as
          hard as the hardest problems in NP, and it is itself a problem in NP. The
          formal statement of Cook's Theorem is:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>"The SAT problem is NP-complete."</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">This means two things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>SAT is in NP:</strong> A solution to a SAT problem (a truth assignment
            to variables) can be verified quickly (in polynomial time).</li>
          <li><strong>SAT is NP-hard:</strong> Any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT
            in polynomial time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Proving Cook's Theorem</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Proving Cook's Theorem involves showing that the Boolean Satisfiability
          Problem (SAT) is NP-complete. The proof is technical and involves two main
          parts:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Proving SAT is in NP:</strong> This is straightforward. Given a
          Boolean formula and an assignment of truth values to variables, we can
          verify in polynomial time whether the formula is satisfied (i.e., evaluates
          to true).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Proving SAT is NP-hard:</strong> This is the crux of the proof.
          It involves showing that any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT. This
          is done by simulating the computation of a nondeterministic Turing machine
          (which defines NP problems) using a Boolean formula.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a high-level overview of how the NP-hardness proof works:</p>
        <h3
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Constructing the SAT Instance from a General NP Problem</strong>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM):</strong> Consider an NTM
            that decides a problem in NP. Without loss of generality, assume this NTM
            runs in polynomial time with respect to the input size.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Simulation with Boolean Formula:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Encoding the Computation:</strong> We encode the entire computation
              of the NTM as a Boolean formula. This includes the state of the machine,
              the symbols on the tape, and the head position at each step.</li>
            <li><strong>Time and Space Polynomial:</strong> Since the NTM runs in polynomial
              time, the number of steps in the computation is polynomial in the size
              of the input. The tape used by the machine is also polynomially bounded.</li>
            <li><strong>Variables and Clauses:</strong> For each tape cell, head position,
              and time step, we create Boolean variables. We then construct clauses that
              represent the transition function of the NTM. These clauses ensure that
              the variables correctly simulate the behavior of the NTM.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial and Final Conditions:</strong> Additional clauses represent
              the initial state (input) of the machine and the accepting condition.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Satisfiability Implies Solution:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the resulting Boolean formula is satisfiable, it encodes a valid computation
              of the NTM that leads to an accepting state. This means the original problem
              instance is a "yes" instance.</li>
            <li>Conversely, if the NTM accepts the input, there exists a sequence of transitions
              leading to an accepting state, which can be encoded as a satisfying assignment
              to the Boolean formula.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The transformation from any NP problem to a SAT instance is done in polynomial
            time (since both the number of variables and the size of the formula are
            polynomial in the size of the NTM's input). Hence, any problem in NP can
            be reduced to SAT, proving that SAT is NP-hard.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Since SAT is both in NP and NP-hard, it is NP-complete, which is the essence
            of Cook's Theorem.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">This proof was groundbreaking because it provided the first concrete example
            of an NP-complete problem and established a method for proving the NP-completeness
            of other problems.</p>
