       <h1>Reducibility </h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Reducibility, in the context of computational complexity theory, is a
          concept that allows us to compare the computational difficulty of different
          problems. It involves transforming one problem into another problem in
          such a way that the solution to the second problem can be used to solve
          the first problem.</p>
        <p>Formally, a problem A is said to be reducible to problem B if there exists
          a polynomial-time algorithm that can transform instances of problem A into
          instances of problem B, such that the solution to the transformed instance
          of problem B can be used to obtain the solution to the original instance
          of problem A.</p>
        <p>The reduction is typically done in two steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Transformation</strong>: The algorithm takes an instance of problem
            A and transforms it into an instance of problem B. This transformation
            should preserve the solution, meaning that if the transformed instance
            of problem B has a solution, it should correspond to a solution of the
            original instance of problem A.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution Extraction</strong>: Once the transformed instance of
            problem B is obtained, the algorithm extracts the solution to problem A
            from the solution to problem B. This step ensures that solving problem
            B can be used to solve problem A.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The reduction is required to be polynomial-time, meaning that the transformation
          and solution extraction steps should be computable in polynomial time.
          This ensures that the reduction itself does not introduce significant additional
          computational complexity.</p>
        <p>Reducibility is a powerful tool in computational complexity theory because
          it allows us to classify problems based on their computational difficulty.
          If problem A is reducible to problem B, and problem B is known to be difficult
          (e.g., NP-complete), then problem A is also at least as difficult as problem
          B. This allows us to establish relationships between different problems
          and understand their relative complexity.</p>
        <p>The concept of reducibility is widely used in complexity theory to prove
          the hardness or completeness of problems. For example, many problems have
          been shown to be NP-complete by demonstrating polynomial-time reductions
          from known NP-complete problems.</p>
        <p>In summary, reducibility is a concept in computational complexity theory
          that allows us to compare the computational difficulty of different problems.
          It involves transforming one problem into another problem in such a way
          that the solution to the second problem can be used to solve the first
          problem. Reducibility is an important tool for understanding the complexity
          of problems and establishing relationships between them.</p>
