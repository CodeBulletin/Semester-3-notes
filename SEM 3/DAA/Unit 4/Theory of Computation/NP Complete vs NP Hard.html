       <h1>NP Complete vs NP Hard</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The concepts of NP-Complete and NP-Hard are fundamental in computational
          complexity theory, a branch of theoretical computer science. They are used
          to classify problems based on their difficulty and the nature of their
          solutions. Here's a comparison:</p>
        <h3>NP-Complete</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>: A problem is NP-Complete if it satisfies
          two conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is in NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time): The problem can be verified
            in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.</li>
          <li>It is as hard as any problem in NP: Any problem in NP can be reduced to
            this problem in polynomial time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Characteristics</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>These problems are both hard to solve and easy to check.</li>
          <li>If one NP-Complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, all problems
            in NP can be solved in polynomial time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Travelling Salesman Problem.</li>
          <li>Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).</li>
          <li>Hamiltonian Path Problem.</li>
          <li>Subset Sum Problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Significance</strong>: Finding a polynomial-time solution for
          any NP-Complete problem would prove that P=NP, a major unsolved question
          in computer science.</p>
        <h3>NP-Hard</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>: A problem is NP-Hard if it is at least as
          hard as the hardest problems in NP. It may or may not be in NP itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>These problems are hard to solve, and they may or may not be easy to check.</li>
          <li>They encompass a broader class of problems than NP-Complete because they
            are not required to be in NP.</li>
          <li>Solving an NP-Hard problem in polynomial time does not necessarily imply
            P=NP, as the problem might not be in NP.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Halting Problem.</li>
          <li>Decision versions of many optimization problems.</li>
          <li>Some types of integer programming.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Significance</strong>: NP-Hard problems are used to demonstrate
          the difficulty of solving certain problems, often used in proofs by reduction
          to show that other problems are also hard.</p>
        <h3>Key Differences</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope</strong>: All NP-Complete problems are a subset of NP-Hard
            problems. NP-Complete problems are in NP, whereas NP-Hard problems may
            or may not be.</li>
          <li><strong>Solvability Implications</strong>: Solving an NP-Complete problem
            efficiently (in polynomial time) implies P=NP, but solving an NP-Hard problem
            does not necessarily have this implication, especially if the problem is
            not in NP.</li>
        </ul>
