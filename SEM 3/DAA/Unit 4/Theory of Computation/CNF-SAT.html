       <h1>CNF-SAT</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">CNF-SAT stands for "Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability." It's a concept
          from the field of computer science, particularly in computational complexity
          theory and logic. Here's a breakdown of what it means:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):</strong> This is a way of structuring
          logical expressions. In CNF, a formula is a conjunction (AND) of clauses,
          where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. A literal is either
          a variable or the negation of a variable. For example, a CNF formula could
          look like this: (X1 OR NOT X2) AND (X2 OR X3 OR NOT X4).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Satisfiability (SAT):</strong> This refers to the problem of determining
          whether there exists an assignment of truth values to the variables in
          a logical formula such that the entire formula evaluates to true. In the
          context of CNF-SAT, it's about finding an assignment of truth values to
          the variables in a CNF formula that makes the formula true.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> CNF-SAT is known to be a NP-complete
          problem. This means it's one of the hardest problems in the class NP (nondeterministic
          polynomial time). If a polynomial-time algorithm can be found for CNF-SAT,
          it would imply that P=NP, solving one of the most famous open problems
          in computer science.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In practical terms, CNF-SAT is important in various fields like artificial
          intelligence, algorithm design, and even in solving real-world problems
          like scheduling, circuit design, and software verification. It's a fundamental
          problem that helps in understanding computational complexity and the limits
          of efficient computation.</p>
