       <h1>TSP proof</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove that the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-complete, we
          use a reduction from the Hamiltonian Circuit Problem, which is known to
          be NP-complete. The Hamiltonian Circuit Problem involves finding a Hamiltonian
          circuit (a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns
          to the starting vertex) in a given graph.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The process involves two main steps:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Show that TSP is in NP:</strong> This means demonstrating that
          any proposed solution (a tour in this case) to the TSP can be verified
          quickly (in polynomial time).</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Show that TSP is NP-hard:</strong> This involves proving that any
          problem in NP, specifically the Hamiltonian Circuit Problem in this case,
          can be reduced to TSP in polynomial time.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. TSP is in NP</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To show that TSP is in NP, we need to demonstrate that given a particular
          tour, we can verify whether this tour is a valid solution (visits each
          city exactly once and returns to the starting city) and whether the total
          distance of the tour is less than or equal to a given value (for decision-version
          TSP) in polynomial time. Verifying a tour involves checking the order of
          cities and summing the distances, which can be done in polynomial time.
          Therefore, TSP is in NP.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. TSP is NP-hard</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">To prove NP-hardness, we use a reduction from the Hamiltonian Circuit
          Problem. The goal is to show that any instance of the Hamiltonian Circuit
          Problem can be transformed into an instance of TSP in such a way that the
          graph has a Hamiltonian circuit if and only if there is a tour in the TSP
          instance with a total distance less than or equal to a specific value.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how the reduction works:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take an instance of the Hamiltonian Circuit Problem,
            represented by a graph&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create an instance of TSP using the same graph&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>. Set the distance between two cities (vertices) to 1 if there
              is an edge between them in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>, and
              to a very large number (say&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(M\)</span>, larger
              than the number of vertices in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>)
              if there is no edge.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set the maximum allowed distance for the TSP tour
                to be equal to the number of vertices in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>.</p>
              <p
              style="margin-left:0px;">Now, if&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;has a Hamiltonian
                circuit, there will be a TSP tour in the corresponding TSP instance with
                a total distance equal to the number of vertices in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>&nbsp;(since
                each edge in the Hamiltonian circuit contributes a distance of 1). Conversely,
                if there is a TSP tour with a total distance equal to the number of vertices
                in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>, it means that the tour only
                uses edges that exist in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>, and
                since it visits each vertex exactly once before returning to the start,
                it forms a Hamiltonian circuit in&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(G\)</span>.</p>
                <p
                style="margin-left:0px;">This transformation can be done in polynomial time. Since we've shown
                  that any instance of the Hamiltonian Circuit Problem can be reduced to
                  TSP in polynomial time, and verifying a TSP solution is in NP, it follows
                  that TSP is NP-complete. This proof has significant implications in computational
                  complexity theory and practical applications involving optimization and
                  routing problems.</p>
