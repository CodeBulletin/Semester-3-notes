       <h1>Circuit satisfiability</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Circuit satisfiability, also known as the Boolean circuit satisfiability
          problem or simply SAT, is a fundamental problem in computer science and
          logic. It involves determining whether there exists an assignment of truth
          values (true or false) to the input variables of a Boolean circuit that
          makes the output of the circuit evaluate to true.</p>
        <p>A Boolean circuit is a directed acyclic graph composed of gates, where
          each gate represents a Boolean function (such as AND, OR, or NOT) and the
          edges represent the flow of information between gates. The input variables
          are connected to the gates, and the output of the circuit is obtained by
          evaluating the gates according to their Boolean functions.</p>
        <p>The circuit satisfiability problem asks whether there exists an assignment
          of truth values to the input variables that causes the output of the circuit
          to be true. In other words, it seeks to determine if there is a combination
          of true and false values for the input variables that satisfies the circuit.</p>
        <p>The SAT problem is a decision problem, meaning that the answer is either
          "yes" (there exists a satisfying assignment) or "no" (there is no satisfying
          assignment). It is a well-known NP-complete problem, which means that it
          is believed to be computationally difficult to solve in the general case.
          However, there are efficient algorithms, such as the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland
          (DPLL) algorithm and its variants, that can solve many instances of SAT
          in practice.</p>
        <p>The SAT problem has numerous applications in various fields, including
          computer science, artificial intelligence, hardware and software verification,
          and cryptography. It serves as a foundation for many other important problems
          and has been extensively studied in the field of computational complexity
          theory.</p>
        <p>In summary, circuit satisfiability (SAT) is the problem of determining
          whether there exists an assignment of truth values to the input variables
          of a Boolean circuit that makes the output of the circuit evaluate to true.
          It is a well-known NP-complete problem with applications in various areas
          of computer science.</p>
