       <h1>N-Queen&#39;s Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The N-Queens Problem is a classic example of a puzzle and a backtracking
          problem in computer science and mathematical theory. Here's an overview:</p>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong>: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard
          so that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move any
          number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Therefore, the
          solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.</p>
        <p><strong>Illustration</strong>: For a standard 8x8 chessboard, the problem
          is to place 8 queens such that none of them can capture any other using
          standard chess moves.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution Complexity</strong>: The problem's complexity increases
          exponentially with N. For small values of N (like N=4 or N=8), it's feasible
          to find solutions manually, but as N increases, manual solutions become
          impractical, and algorithmic approaches are necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>Backtracking Solution</strong>: The N-Queens Problem is commonly
          solved using backtracking. The approach typically involves placing a queen
          in a valid position in the first row, then moving to the next row to place
          another queen. If a valid position is not found in the next row (i.e.,
          all positions lead to conflicts), the algorithm backtracks to the previous
          row to move the queen to the next valid position and tries again.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications</strong>: While it may seem like a theoretical problem,
          the N-Queens puzzle has practical applications in computer science, particularly
          in algorithm theory for solving constraint satisfaction problems. It's
          a model for many types of real-world problems where a number of conditions
          must be met without conflicts.</p>
        <p><strong>Variations</strong>: There are variations of the problem, like
          extending the chessboard size (greater than 8x8), or placing additional
          constraints on the queens' placement.</p>
        <p>The N-Queens Problem is an excellent example to understand and practice
          backtracking algorithms, showcasing how to explore potential solutions
          systematically and backtrack when a path leads to a conflict.</p>
        <p><strong>Time Complexity Analysis</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Worst-case scenario</strong>: The most straightforward analysis
            is for the worst-case scenario, which is exponential in nature, O(N!).
            This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm tries every possible
            arrangement of queens.</li>
