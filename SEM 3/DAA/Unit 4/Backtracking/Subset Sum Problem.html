       <h1>Subset Sum Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Subset Sum Problem is a classic issue in computer science and combinatorial
          optimization. It's part of a broader category of problems known as NP-complete
          problems, which are significant both in theoretical computer science and
          practical applications.</p>
        <p>Here's a basic overview of the Subset Sum Problem:</p>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Given a set of integers and a target
          sum, determine if there's a subset of these integers that adds up to the
          target sum.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Let's say we have a set of integers: {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2} and the target
            sum is 9.</li>
          <li>The question is: is there a subset of these numbers that adds up to 9?</li>
          <li>In this case, the answer is yes. The subset {4, 5} adds up to 9.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem is interesting because it's simple to state and understand,
            but can be very challenging to solve, especially as the size of the set
            increases.</li>
          <li>It's used in various fields like cryptography, complexity theory, and
            in solving real-world problems that involve resource allocation or decision-making
            under constraints.</li>
        </ul>
