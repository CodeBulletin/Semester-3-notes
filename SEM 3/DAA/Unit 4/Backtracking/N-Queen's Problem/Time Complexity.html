       <h1>Time Complexity</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The N Queens Problem is a classic problem in computer science and combinatorics,
          where the task is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such
          a way that no two queens threaten each other. One common approach to solving
          this problem is by using backtracking.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The time complexity of the N Queens Problem using backtracking is typically
          expressed as O(N!), where N is the size of the chessboard (number of rows
          and columns). This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm needs to
          explore all possible combinations of queen placements.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a brief explanation of why the time complexity is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(n!)\)</span>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the first row, you have&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;choices
            for placing the queen.</li>
          <li>In the second row, you have (<span class="math-tex">\(n-1\)</span>) choices
            (since you cannot place a queen in the same column or in a directly threatened
            diagonal).</li>
          <li>In the third row, you have (<span class="math-tex">\(n-2\)</span>) choices,
            and so on.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The total number of possibilities is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1\)</span>,
          which is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n!\)</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">It's important to note that although&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n!\)</span>&nbsp;is
          a tight upper bound, the actual number of possibilities explored during
          backtracking may be significantly less due to the pruning of search space
          based on constraints and heuristics.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In practice, the performance of the backtracking algorithm for the N Queens
          Problem can be quite good for small to moderate values of N, but it becomes
          impractical for larger values of N due to the exponential growth in the
          number of possibilities.</p>
