        <p><strong>Classification of N-Queens in NP</strong>: The N-Queens Problem
          is in NP because, given a particular arrangement of queens, one can efficiently
          verify whether it's a valid solution (i.e., no two queens attack each other).
          However, finding that arrangement (solution) is not necessarily efficient
          (i.e., polynomial time), especially as N grows larger.</p>
