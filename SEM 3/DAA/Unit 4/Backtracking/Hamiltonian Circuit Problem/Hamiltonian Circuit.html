       <h1>Hamiltonian Circuit</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A Hamiltonian circuit is a concept in graph theory, a branch of mathematics.
          It refers to a circuit that visits every vertex of a graph exactly once
          and returns to the starting vertex, forming a closed path.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In simpler terms, a Hamiltonian circuit is a path that starts and ends
          at the same vertex and includes all the other vertices of the graph without
          revisiting any vertex. If such a circuit exists in a graph, the graph is
          said to be Hamiltonian.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">A related concept is a Hamiltonian path, which is a path that visits each
          vertex exactly once but may not necessarily return to the starting vertex.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Determining whether a Hamiltonian circuit or path exists in a given graph
          is a well-known problem in graph theory and is known to be NP-complete,
          meaning there is no known efficient algorithm to solve it for all possible
          cases. However, for certain types of graphs, specific conditions or algorithms
          may help identify the presence or absence of Hamiltonian circuits.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Complete Bipartite Graphs:</strong> A complete bipartite graph&nbsp;
              <span
              class="math-tex">\(K_{m,n}\)</span>â€‹ (where m and n are both greater than or equal to 2)
                does not have a Hamiltonian circuit. These graphs have two disjoint sets
                of vertices, and there are no edges between vertices within the same set.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Disconnected Graphs:</strong> If a graph is disconnected (meaning
              it consists of two or more disconnected components), and at least one of
              the components has an odd number of vertices, then the entire graph cannot
              have a Hamiltonian circuit. This is because a Hamiltonian circuit must
              visit each vertex exactly once, and if there is an odd component, the circuit
              cannot return to the starting vertex.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Graphs with "Choke Points":</strong> Some graphs have vertices
                with relatively high degrees compared to the rest of the graph, creating
                "choke points" that may prevent the existence of a Hamiltonian circuit.
                This is related to the conditions mentioned in Dirac's and Ore's theorems,
                where high-degree vertices increase the likelihood of a Hamiltonian circuit.</p>
              <p
              style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Graphs With Pendant Nodes: </strong>Some graphs have nodes with
                1 degree these type of graphs do not have a Hamiltonian circuit</p>
