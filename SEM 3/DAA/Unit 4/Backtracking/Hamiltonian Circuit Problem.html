       <h1>Hamiltonian Circuit Problem</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>The Hamiltonian Circuit Problem is a classic problem in graph theory and
          combinatorial optimization. It involves finding a Hamiltonian circuit (or
          Hamiltonian cycle) in a given graph. A Hamiltonian circuit is a path in
          a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting
          vertex, forming a cycle.</p>
        <h3>Key Points</h3>
        <p><strong>Hamiltonian Circuit:</strong> It's a loop that visits every vertex
          of a graph exactly once. The starting and ending vertices are the same.</p>
        <p><strong>Graph Types:</strong> This problem can be applied to both directed
          and undirected graphs.</p>
        <p><strong>Difference from Eulerian Path:</strong> Unlike an Eulerian path,
          which requires passing through every edge exactly once, a Hamiltonian circuit
          requires visiting every vertex exactly once.</p>
        <h3>Hamiltonian Circuit Problem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Decision Version:</strong> Given a graph, the question is whether
            the graph contains a Hamiltonian circuit. This version is a yes/no question:
            Does a Hamiltonian circuit exist in the graph?</li>
          <li><strong>Search Version:</strong> If a Hamiltonian circuit exists, find
            such a circuit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Complexity</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem of determining whether a given graph contains a Hamiltonian
            circuit is NP-complete. This means there is no known polynomial-time algorithm
            to solve this problem for all general graphs.</li>
          <li>For specific types of graphs, such as complete graphs, finding a Hamiltonian
            circuit can be straightforward. However, for arbitrary graphs, it can be
            quite challenging.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Algorithms and Approaches</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> Checking all possible permutations of the
            vertices to see if there's a Hamiltonian circuit. This approach is computationally
            expensive.</li>
          <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> A more refined version of brute force, where
            the path is built incrementally and abandoned as soon as it is clear that
            it cannot lead to a Hamiltonian circuit.</li>
          <li><strong>Heuristic Methods:</strong> For large graphs, heuristic and approximation
            methods are used, although they don't guarantee a solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Hamiltonian Circuit Problem is important in various fields, including
            logistics and network routing, where a path needs to visit certain points
            exactly once.</li>
          <li>It's also foundational in the study of computational complexity and algorithm
            design.</li>
        </ul>
