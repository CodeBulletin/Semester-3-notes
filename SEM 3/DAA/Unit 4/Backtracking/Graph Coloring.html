       <h1>Graph Coloring</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>In the Graph Coloring Problem, you are given a graph and a set of colors.
          The objective is to assign a color to each vertex of the graph such that
          no two adjacent vertices (i.e., vertices connected by an edge) have the
          same color. The goal is often to minimize the number of colors used.</p>
        <h3>Types</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Vertex Coloring:</strong> The most common form, where colors are
            assigned to vertices.</li>
          <li><strong>Edge Coloring:</strong> Colors are assigned to edges so that no
            two edges sharing a common vertex have the same color.</li>
          <li><strong>Face Coloring:</strong> In planar graphs, coloring the faces of
            the graph so that no two faces sharing a boundary have the same color.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scheduling Problems:</strong> Assigning time slots or resources
            where conflicts must be avoided.</li>
          <li><strong>Map Coloring:</strong> Such as coloring political maps with different
            colors for adjacent countries.</li>
          <li><strong>Register Allocation:</strong> In compiler optimization, where different
            variables are assigned to different registers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Complexity</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem is known for its computational difficulty. Determining if
            a graph can be colored with two colors (bipartite graph) is polynomial
            in time; however, deciding if a graph can be colored with three or more
            colors is NP-complete.</li>
          <li>The simplest version, deciding if a graph can be colored with two colors,
            is solvable in linear time. This is equivalent to checking if the graph
            is bipartite.</li>
          <li>For more than two colors, efficient algorithms are known only for special
            types of graphs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Greedy Coloring:</strong> A simple heuristic used in algorithms.
            It assigns colors one by one to vertices, picking the first available color.</li>
          <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> A brute-force approach that tries all possible
            colorings.</li>
          <li><strong>Approximation Algorithms:</strong> For some versions of the problem,
            especially when minimizing the number of colors is important.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chromatic Number</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph is known as its chromatic
            number. Determining the chromatic number of a general graph is an NP-hard
            problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without any conditions it takes&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(C^{n+1}\)</span>&nbsp;time
          to compute where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(C\)</span>&nbsp;is number
          of colors,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;is number of nodes</p>
