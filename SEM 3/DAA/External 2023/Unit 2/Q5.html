        <h2>Explain KMP Algorithm for String Matching. Illustrate its working when the text is aaabaadaabaaa and the pattern is aabaa? Repeat the process for Naive string pattern matching algorithm</h2>
        <p><span class="text-big"><strong>KMP Algorithm</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">KMP Algorithm is a string matching algorithm where we are given a string
          text and another string pattern and then we have to find the occurrence
          of patteren in the text</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The key idea behind the KMP algorithm is to avoid redundant character
          comparisons by using a precomputed partial match table, often referred
          to as the "failure function" or "prefix function." This table is used to
          determine how far to shift the pattern during the search, thus avoiding
          comparing the same characters multiple times.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a high-level overview of how the KMP algorithm works:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Preprocessing</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a prefix function (or failure function) for the pattern string.
            This function stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern
            that is also a suffix of that prefix. The goal is to use this information
            to avoid unnecessary character comparisons during the search.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Searching</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with both the text and pattern pointers at the beginning.</li>
          <li>Compare the characters of the text and pattern:
            <ul>
              <li>If they match, increment both pointers.</li>
              <li>If they don't match, use the prefix function to determine how far to shift
                the pattern. This allows the algorithm to skip some characters in the text
                without missing potential matches.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Repeat the comparison and shifting until you reach the end of the text
            or find a full match of the pattern.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The key to the KMP algorithm's efficiency is the ability to calculate
          how far the pattern can be shifted during a mismatch efficiently using
          the prefix function. This allows the algorithm to avoid redundant character
          comparisons and, in the worst case, performs pattern matching in linear
          time with respect to the length of the text and pattern.</p>
