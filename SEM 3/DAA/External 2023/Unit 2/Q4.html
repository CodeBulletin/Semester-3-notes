        <h2>Explain Divide and conquer. How Strassen applied it to the matrix problem? Compare the asymptotic time complexity of the classical matrix multiplication algorithm to Strassen's algorithm?</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Divide and Conquer approach is a problem-solving technique used in
          various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and algorithms.
          It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable
          subproblems, solving those subproblems independently, and then combining
          their solutions to solve the original problem. The key idea is to divide
          a problem into smaller parts, conquer each part, and then combine the results.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The Divide and Conquer approach typically consists of three main steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Divide</strong>: The problem is divided into smaller, often equal-sized,
              subproblems. This division continues until the subproblems are simple enough
              to be solved directly. The goal is to break the problem into smaller, more
              manageable pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Conquer</strong>: Each subproblem is solved independently. This
              can involve applying the same Divide and Conquer approach recursively to
              further subdivide the subproblems until they become trivial to solve. In
              some cases, the subproblems are solved using other techniques, such as
              brute force or dynamic programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong>: The solutions to the subproblems are combined
              to obtain a solution for the original problem. This step can involve aggregating
              results, merging data, or performing additional computations as needed.</li>
          </ol><pre><code class="language-text-plain">DAC(p) {
	if (small(p)) {
	    solve(p)
	}
	else {
	    Divide the problem into p1, p2, p3, ..., pk
	    Apply DAC(p1), DAC(p2), DAC(p3), ... DAC(pk)
		Combine DAC(p1), DAC(p2), DAC(p3), ... DAC(pk)

          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="text-big"><strong>Strassen's Matrix Multiplication</strong></span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Strassen's Matrix Multiplication is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for
            multiplying two matrices. It was developed by Volker Strassen in 1969 and
            is known for its efficiency in reducing the number of basic multiplications
            required compared to the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">The basic idea behind Strassen's algorithm is to divide each of the two
            input matrices into smaller submatrices, perform a limited number of recursive
            multiplications (subproblems), and then combine the results to obtain the
            final matrix product. This approach reduces the number of multiplications
            needed, which results in improved time complexity for large matrices.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;">The Strassen's algorithm divides the matrix multiplication problem into
              seven multiplications of smaller submatrices, along with some additional
              matrix additions and subtractions.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Input: Two n x n matrices A and B
Output: The product of A and B, i.e., A * B

1. If n is not a power of 2, pad both A and B with zeros to make them of size 2^k x 2^k where 2^k &gt;= n.

2. If the matrices are small enough (e.g., 1x1 or 2x2), perform and return the standard matrix multiplication.

3. Divide each matrix into four sub-matrices. 
   For A: A11, A12, A21, A22
   For B: B11, B12, B21, B22

4. Recursively compute the seven products using Strassen's formulas:
   M1 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A11 + A22, B11 + B22)
   M2 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A21 + A22, B11)
   M3 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A11, B12 - B22)
   M4 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A22, B21 - B11)
   M5 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A11 + A12, B22)
   M6 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A21 - A11, B11 + B12)
   M7 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A12 - A22, B21 + B22)

5. Combine the intermediate matrices to get the four parts of the result matrix:
   C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7
   C12 = M3 + M5
   C21 = M2 + M4
   C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6

6. Combine C11, C12, C21, and C22 to get the final result matrix C.

7. If padding was added in step 1, truncate C to get the final n x n product matrix.

8. Return the final product matrix.</code></pre>

              <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Classical Algorithm</strong>: The classical algorithm for matrix
                multiplication has a time complexity of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(n^3)\)</span>.
                This is because it performs a cubic number of operations relative to the
                matrix size.</p>

                This is derived from the master theorem for divide and conquer recurrences,

                additions and subtractions.</p>
