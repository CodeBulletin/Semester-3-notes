        <h2>Comment on the Tradeoff in between the Time and Space Complexity of an Algorithm. State Masters theorem. What is the regulatory condition?</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The tradeoff between time and space complexity in algorithms is a fundamental
          concept in computer science. Here's a brief explanation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> It refers to the amount of time an algorithm
            takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Common time
            complexities include constant time (O(1)), logarithmic time (O(log n)),
            linear time (O(n)), quadratic time (O(n²)), and so forth.</li>
          <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> This refers to the amount of memory
            space an algorithm needs to run as a function of the length of the input.
            Like time complexity, it can vary from constant space (O(1)) to space that
            increases linearly with the input size (O(n)), and more.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Tradeoff Between Time and Space Complexity:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Direct Tradeoff:</strong> Often, an algorithm can be made faster
            (lower time complexity) by using more memory (higher space complexity),
            and vice versa. For example, memoization (caching results) can significantly
            speed up algorithms at the cost of more memory usage.</li>
          <li><strong>Balancing Act:</strong> In practical applications, the choice between
            a time-efficient algorithm and a space-efficient algorithm depends on the
            constraints and requirements of the specific situation, such as available
            memory and acceptable execution time. though in today's time the time complexity
            is more important as we have lots memory in our systems</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Master's Theorem</strong> is a key tool in the analysis of the
          time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms. The theorem provides
          a way to analyze such algorithms by providing asymptotic bounds (like O(n
          log n), O(n²), etc.) for recurrences of the form:</p>
        <figure class="image">
          <img src="Q2/image.png">
        </figure>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;is the number of subproblems
            in the recursion.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(\frac n b\)</span>&nbsp;is the size of each subproblem.
            (Assume that all subproblems are essentially the same size.)</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(f(n)\)</span>&nbsp;is the cost of the work done
            outside the recursive calls, which includes the cost of dividing the problem
            and combining the results of the subproblems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Master's Theorem Regulatory Condition:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Master’s Theorem applies under certain regularity conditions, the
          most common being:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>&nbsp;should be greater than or equal
            to 1, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span>&nbsp;should be greater
            than 1.</li>
          <li><span class="math-tex">\(f(n)\)</span>&nbsp;should be asymptotically positive&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(f(n) &gt; 0\)</span>&nbsp;for sufficiently large&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>.</li>
          <li>The subproblems should be of approximately equal size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Master's Theorem does not apply to all divide-and-conquer recurrences,
          particularly those that do not meet these regularity conditions or have
          non-standard forms. In such cases, other methods, such as the Akra-Bazzi
          theorem or case-by-case analysis, may be required.</p>
