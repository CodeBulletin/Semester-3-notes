        <h2>Define the basic ingredients of Greedy Method in the Context of Kruskal's Algorithms and Explain and analyze it's time Complexity</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Greedy Method is an algorithmic approach that makes a series of choices,
          each of which is the best or most optimal at that moment, without regard
          to future consequences. This method is used in various algorithms, including
          Kruskal's algorithm, which is designed for finding the minimum spanning
          tree of a graph.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Basic Ingredients of the Greedy Method in Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Sorting of Edges</strong>: Kruskal's algorithm starts by sorting
          all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weight.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Edge Selection</strong>: After sorting, it processes the edges
          in the sorted order and applies the following greedy criterion: if adding
          the edge to the growing forest does not create a cycle, the edge is included
          in the solution; otherwise, it is discarded. This is the "greedy" step,
          as it chooses the smallest edge that doesn't form a cycle.</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Disjoint Sets</strong>: To efficiently detect cycles, Kruskal's
            algorithm uses a disjoint-set data structure. This structure helps to keep
            track of the subsets of vertices and allows for quick checks of whether
            two vertices belong to the same subset (i.e., whether adding an edge would
            create a cycle).</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Termination</strong>: The algorithm terminates when all vertices
            are connected or all edges have been processed.</p>
