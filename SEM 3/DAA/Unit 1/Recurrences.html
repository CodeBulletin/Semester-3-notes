       <h1>Recurrences</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In the context of time complexity analysis in computer science and algorithms,
          a recurrence, or recurrence relation, is a mathematical equation or formula
          that describes the time complexity of an algorithm or the behavior of a
          recursive function. Recurrences are commonly used to analyze the time complexity
          of algorithms, especially when the algorithm's time complexity depends
          on the size of the input or the number of recursive calls it makes.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Recurrences are particularly useful for expressing and solving algorithms
          with recursive structures, such as divide-and-conquer algorithms (e.g.,
          merge sort, quicksort), recursive functions, and data structures (e.g.,
          binary trees).</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how recurrences work and why they are important:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Defining the Relation</strong>: Recurrences define a relation
              between the time complexity of a problem of a certain size and the time
              complexity of smaller instances of the same problem. In other words, they
              express how the time required to solve a problem of size n is related to
              the time required to solve smaller instances of the same problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Base Case</strong>: A recurrence relation typically includes a
              base case or termination condition. This base case describes the time complexity
              for the smallest possible problem instances, which can be solved directly
              without further recursion.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursive Case</strong>: The recurrence relation also describes
              how the time complexity for a problem of size n depends on the time complexities
              of smaller instances of the same problem. This is often expressed in a
              recursive formula.</li>
            <li><strong>Solving the Recurrence</strong>: Solving a recurrence means finding
              a closed-form solution for the time complexity of the algorithm or function
              in terms of the input size. Solving the recurrence often involves mathematical
              techniques, such as substitution, master theorem, or iterative expansion,
              depending on the form of the recurrence.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyzing Time Complexity</strong>: Once the recurrence is solved,
              you can analyze the time complexity of the algorithm or function for any
              input size. This analysis provides insights into how the algorithm's time
              requirements grow with the input size.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">For example, consider the recurrence relation for the time complexity
            of the merge sort algorithm:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><span class="math-tex">\(T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}2)+O(n)\)</span>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">In this recurrence, T(n) represents the time required to sort an array
            of size n. The relation states that to sort an array of size n, the algorithm
            recursively sorts two subarrays of size n/2 and then combines them, which
            takes O(n) time. This recurrence can be solved to determine that merge
            sort has a time complexity of O(n log n).</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Recurrence relations are a powerful tool for characterizing and understanding
            the time complexity of recursive algorithms. They allow you to express
            and analyze the efficiency of algorithms in a precise and mathematical
            way, which is essential for designing and optimizing algorithms for various
            applications.</p>
