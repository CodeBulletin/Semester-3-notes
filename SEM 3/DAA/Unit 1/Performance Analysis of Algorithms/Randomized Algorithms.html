       <h1>Randomized Algorithms</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Randomized algorithms are a class of algorithms that use randomness or
          random sampling as an integral part of their design. Unlike deterministic
          algorithms, which produce the same output for a given input every time,
          randomized algorithms make use of random choices during their execution.
          These algorithms have a wide range of applications in computer science,
          mathematics, and various other fields. Here are some key concepts and characteristics
          of randomized algorithms:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Randomness as a Resource</strong>: Randomized algorithms employ
          randomness as a resource to solve problems more efficiently or to provide
          probabilistic guarantees. By introducing randomness, they often achieve
          better expected performance, even if their behavior can vary from one run
          to another.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Probabilistic Analysis</strong>: Rather than providing deterministic
          guarantees, randomized algorithms often come with probabilistic guarantees.
          They aim to achieve the correct result with high probability, and their
          analysis typically involves probability theory and statistics.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Monte Carlo vs. Las Vegas Algorithms</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Monte Carlo Algorithms</strong>: These algorithms use randomness
            to quickly produce an answer that might be incorrect with a small probability.
            However, they can often be run very fast and can be employed in situations
            where speed is crucial. Users can trade off the probability of correctness
            for runtime efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Las Vegas Algorithms</strong>: These algorithms use randomness
            to ensure that they always produce the correct result. The trade-off here
            is that while they guarantee correctness, their runtime may vary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Random Sampling</strong>: Many randomized algorithms make use
          of random sampling techniques. For example, randomized algorithms for approximating
          mathematical constants, like Ï€ or e, often use Monte Carlo methods that
          involve random sampling.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Parallelization</strong>: Randomized algorithms can be particularly
          well-suited for parallel and distributed computing environments. The use
          of randomization can help avoid contention and improve scalability.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Applications</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Randomized Data Structures</strong>: Data structures like skip
              lists and randomized binary search trees use randomization to achieve average-case
              performance guarantees.</li>
            <li><strong>Numerical Approximation</strong>: Randomized algorithms are used
              for approximating the value of mathematical constants, solving systems
              of linear equations, and estimating probabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Graph Algorithms</strong>: Randomized algorithms are employed
              in graph theory for tasks like graph coloring, finding matchings, and solving
              network problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptography</strong>: Randomized algorithms are used in cryptographic
              protocols, such as those based on the probabilistic primality testing of
              large numbers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Randomized Rounding</strong>: In combinatorial optimization, randomized
            rounding is a technique that uses randomization to round fractional solutions
            to integer solutions in such a way that the expected value of the rounded
            solution is a good approximation to the optimal integer solution</p>
