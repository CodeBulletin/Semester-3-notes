       <h1>Amortized time complexity</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Amortized time complexity is a concept in computer science for analyzing
          an algorithm's average time per operation over a series of operations.
          It's useful for algorithms with occasional costly operations amid mostly
          faster ones, as it spreads the cost of expensive operations across the
          entire sequence, giving a more accurate average performance measure.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">Three methods to calculate amortized time complexity are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Aggregate Analysis</strong>: Totals the cost of a series of operations
              and divides by the number of operations. It works well when operations
              are similar and their costs can be easily summed.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>The Accounting Method</strong>: Assigns different costs to operations,
              with some overpaying to cover future expensive operations, akin to saving
              money for future costs.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>The Potential Method</strong>: Similar to the concept of potential
              energy in physics, it assigns a potential to the data structure after each
              operation. The potential represents stored work that can be used for future
              operations. The amortized cost includes the actual cost plus the change
              in potential.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Amortized time complexity is particularly relevant for data structures
            like binary heaps, hash tables, and splay trees, where infrequent but costly
            operations don't significantly affect overall performance.</p>
