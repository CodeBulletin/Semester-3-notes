       <h1>Algorithms</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a
          specific problem or accomplishing a particular task. It is a well-defined
          sequence of instructions that can be followed to perform a computation,
          make a decision, or solve a problem. Algorithms are fundamental to computer
          science and programming, but they are also used in various other fields,
          including mathematics, engineering, and everyday life.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Key characteristics of algorithms include:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Input</strong>: Algorithms take some input, which can be data,
          variables, or information that the algorithm processes.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Output</strong>: Algorithms produce an output, which is the result
          of the computation or task they were designed to perform.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Finiteness</strong>: Algorithms must terminate after a finite
          number of steps. In other words, they cannot run indefinitely.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Determinism</strong>: For a given input, an algorithm should produce
          the same output every time it is executed. It should be predictable and
          not rely on randomness.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Clear and Unambiguous</strong>: Algorithms should have well-defined
          and precise instructions that leave no room for ambiguity. Each step must
          be clear and understandable.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Effectiveness</strong>: An algorithm should be able to solve the
          problem it is designed for using a finite amount of resources, including
          time and memory.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Algorithms can vary in complexity, from simple ones that can be described
          in a few lines of code to highly complex algorithms used in areas like
          artificial intelligence, cryptography, and scientific simulations. They
          are essential in computer programming, as computer programs are essentially
          sets of algorithms that dictate how a computer should perform various tasks
          and computations.</p>
