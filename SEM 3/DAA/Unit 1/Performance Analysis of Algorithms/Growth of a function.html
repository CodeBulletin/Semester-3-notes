       <h1>Growth of a function</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The growth of a function refers to how the function's output (or value)
          changes relative to the size of its input (or argument). It is a way of
          characterizing how quickly a function's values increase as the input grows
          larger. In mathematics and computer science, understanding the growth of
          functions is important for analyzing the efficiency and performance of
          algorithms, among other applications.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Commonly used terms to describe the growth of functions include:</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Constant Growth</strong>: A function is said to have constant
          growth if its output remains the same regardless of the size of the input.
          In big O notation, this is represented as O(1).</p>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Linear Growth</strong>: A function exhibits linear growth if its
            output increases in a straight line as the input increases. In big O notation,
            this is represented as O(n), where "n" is the size of the input.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Logarithmic Growth</strong>: A function has logarithmic growth
            if its output grows at a decreasing rate, often in a logarithmic or sublinear
            fashion. In big O notation, this is represented as O(log n).</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Polynomial Growth</strong>: A function exhibits polynomial growth
              if its output increases at a rate proportional to some power of the input.
              For example, O(n^2) represents quadratic growth, and O(n^k) represents
              polynomial growth of order "k."</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Exponential Growth</strong>: A function has exponential growth
              if its output grows at an increasing rate, often as a fixed base raised
              to the power of the input. In big O notation, this is represented as O(b^n),
              where "b" is a constant base.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Factorial Growth</strong>: A function grows factorially if its
              output increases at a rate proportional to the factorial of the input.
              In big O notation, this is represented as O(n!), where "n" is the size
              of the input.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">Analyzing the growth of functions, often expressed using big O notation,
              helps in assessing the efficiency of algorithms and data structures. It
              provides a way to compare different algorithms' performance in terms of
              their resource usage (such as time and memory) as the input size grows.
              Algorithms with lower-order growth are generally considered more efficient,
              as they can handle larger inputs without significant increases in resource
              consumption.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">For example, if you have an algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity, its
              performance will degrade much faster as the input size increases compared
              to an algorithm with O(n) time complexity, especially for large input values.
              Understanding the growth of functions is fundamental in algorithm analysis
              and optimization.</p>
