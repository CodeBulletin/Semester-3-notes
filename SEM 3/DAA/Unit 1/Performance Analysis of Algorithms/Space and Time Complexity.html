        <ul>
          <li>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes
            to complete its task as a function of the input size. It provides an upper
            bound on the running time of an algorithm, expressed in terms of the input
            size. Commonly used notations for time complexity include big O notation
            (e.g., O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(1)).</li>
          <li>Time complexity analysis considers the number of basic operations (such
            as comparisons, assignments, and arithmetic operations) that an algorithm
            performs in the worst-case scenario.</li>
          <li>The goal is to understand how the algorithm's running time increases or
            decreases as the input size grows. An algorithm with lower time complexity
            is considered more efficient, as it can handle larger inputs in less time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Space Complexity</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory (space) an algorithm
            uses to execute as a function of the input size. It provides an upper bound
            on the amount of memory the algorithm will require.</li>
          <li>Space complexity analysis considers the memory used for data structures,
            variables, and auxiliary storage (e.g., arrays, lists, and other data structures).</li>
          <li>The goal is to understand how the algorithm's memory consumption increases
            or decreases as the input size grows. An algorithm with lower space complexity
            is considered more memory-efficient.</li>
