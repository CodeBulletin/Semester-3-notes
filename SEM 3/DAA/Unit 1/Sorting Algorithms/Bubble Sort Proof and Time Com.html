        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Defining the Loop Invariant</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">For Bubble Sort, the loop invariant we consider is:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">"At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (say, the i-th iteration),
          the last i elements of the array are in their final sorted position."</p>
        <h3
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Initialization</strong>
          </h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Before the first iteration of the loop (i.e., when <strong>i = 0</strong>),
            the invariant holds trivially because there are no "last elements" to consider,
            so there's nothing to sort.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Maintenance</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">Assuming the invariant is true before an iteration of the loop, we need
            to show it remains true after the iteration. During the i-th iteration,
            the algorithm bubbles the largest element within the unsorted part of the
            array to the end of this part. Therefore, after completing the i-th iteration,
            the last i + 1 elements are in their final sorted position. This maintains
            the invariant.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Termination</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">At the end of the algorithm, when the outer loop completes, the invariant
            tells us that the last n elements are in their final sorted position. Since
            the array only contains n elements, this means the entire array is sorted.</p>
          <h3
          style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
            </h3>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">The maintenance of the loop invariant, along with its initialization and
              termination conditions, prove that the Bubble Sort algorithm correctly
              sorts the list. Each iteration of the loop moves the largest element within
              the unsorted part to its final position, ensuring that the array is fully
              sorted when the algorithm completes.</p>
