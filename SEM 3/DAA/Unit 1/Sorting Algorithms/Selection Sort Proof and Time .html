        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Defining the Loop Invariant</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The loop invariant we can consider for Selection Sort is:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">"At the start of each iteration of the loop (say, the i-th iteration),
          the first i elements of the array are sorted and are the smallest i elements
          of the array."</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Initialization</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Before the first iteration of the loop (i.e., when <strong>i = 0</strong>),
          the invariant holds because there are no elements in the sorted section,
          and thus it is trivially sorted.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Maintenance</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Assuming the invariant is true before an iteration of the loop, it must
          be shown that it remains true after the iteration. In the i-th iteration,
          the algorithm selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the
          array and swaps it with the element at the i-th position. This ensures
          that the first i+1 elements are sorted and are the smallest i+1 elements
          of the array. This maintains the invariant.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Termination</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">At the end of the algorithm, when the loop completes, the invariant tells
          us that the first n elements are sorted and are the smallest n elements
          of the array, where n is the total number of elements in the array. Since
          these are all the elements in the array, it follows that the entire array
          is sorted.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The maintenance of the loop invariant, along with its initialization and
          termination conditions, proves that the Selection Sort algorithm correctly
          sorts the array. Each iteration of the loop extends the sorted section
          of the array by one element, ensuring that the array is fully sorted when
          the algorithm completes.</p>
