       <h1>String Matching</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">String matching is the process of finding and identifying the occurrences
          or instances of one string (called the "pattern") within another string
          (called the "text" or "source string"). This technique is widely used in
          computer science, data processing, and various applications, such as text
          processing, search engines, and information retrieval.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">There are different methods and algorithms for string matching, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Exact String Matching:</strong> This involves finding the exact
            occurrences of a given pattern within a text. The most basic and straightforward
            method is to use simple string comparison. More advanced algorithms, like
            the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm and the Boyer-Moore algorithm, are
            more efficient for large texts.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Approximate String Matching:</strong> In some cases, it's necessary
            to find approximate matches or similar strings. Algorithms like the Levenshtein
            distance or the Jaccard similarity measure are used for this purpose. These
            algorithms measure the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between two
            strings.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Regular Expressions:</strong> Regular expressions (regex) provide
            a powerful way to match patterns in text. They allow you to define complex
            search patterns, which can be used for searching, extracting, and manipulating
            text.</li>
          <li style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Substring Search:</strong> Substring search is a specific form
            of string matching where you look for a substring within a larger string.
            This is often done using simple techniques like searching for substrings
            using built-in functions or using more advanced data structures like tries.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">String matching has numerous practical applications, such as searching
          for keywords in a document, validating user input, data mining, text editing,
          and many others. The choice of algorithm or method depends on the specific
          use case, the size of the data, and the desired level of precision.</p>
