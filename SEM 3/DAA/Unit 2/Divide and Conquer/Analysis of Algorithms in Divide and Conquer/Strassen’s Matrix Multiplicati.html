       <h1>Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Strassen's Matrix Multiplication is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for
          multiplying two matrices. It was developed by Volker Strassen in 1969 and
          is known for its efficiency in reducing the number of basic multiplications
          required compared to the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The basic idea behind Strassen's algorithm is to divide each of the two
          input matrices into smaller submatrices, perform a limited number of recursive
          multiplications (subproblems), and then combine the results to obtain the
          final matrix product. This approach reduces the number of multiplications
          needed, which results in improved time complexity for large matrices.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">The Strassen's algorithm divides the matrix multiplication problem into
            seven multiplications of smaller submatrices, along with some additional
            matrix additions and subtractions.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Input: Two n x n matrices A and B
Output: The product of A and B, i.e., A * B

1. If n is not a power of 2, pad both A and B with zeros to make them of size 2^k x 2^k where 2^k &gt;= n.

2. If the matrices are small enough (e.g., 1x1 or 2x2), perform and return the standard matrix multiplication.

3. Divide each matrix into four sub-matrices. 
   For A: A11, A12, A21, A22
   For B: B11, B12, B21, B22

4. Recursively compute the seven products using Strassen's formulas:
   M1 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A11 + A22, B11 + B22)
   M2 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A21 + A22, B11)
   M3 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A11, B12 - B22)
   M4 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A22, B21 - B11)
   M5 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A11 + A12, B22)
   M6 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A21 - A11, B11 + B12)
   M7 = StrassenMatrixMultiply(A12 - A22, B21 + B22)

5. Combine the intermediate matrices to get the four parts of the result matrix:
   C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7
   C12 = M3 + M5
   C21 = M2 + M4
   C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6

6. Combine C11, C12, C21, and C22 to get the final result matrix C.

7. If padding was added in step 1, truncate C to get the final n x n product matrix.

8. Return the final product matrix.</code></pre>
