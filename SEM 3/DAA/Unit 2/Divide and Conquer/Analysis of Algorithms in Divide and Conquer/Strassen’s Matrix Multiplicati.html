       <h1>Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication Method</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Strassen's Matrix Multiplication is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for
          multiplying two matrices. It was developed by Volker Strassen in 1969 and
          is known for its efficiency in reducing the number of basic multiplications
          required compared to the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The basic idea behind Strassen's algorithm is to divide each of the two
          input matrices into smaller submatrices, perform a limited number of recursive
          multiplications (subproblems), and then combine the results to obtain the
          final matrix product. This approach reduces the number of multiplications
          needed, which results in improved time complexity for large matrices.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">The Strassen's algorithm divides the matrix multiplication problem into
            seven multiplications of smaller submatrices, along with some additional
            matrix additions and subtractions.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">def strassen(x, y):
