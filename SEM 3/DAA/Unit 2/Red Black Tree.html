       <h1>Red Black Tree</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree data structure.
          They were developed to ensure that a binary search tree remains approximately
          balanced, which helps to maintain efficient operations for searching, insertion,
          and deletion.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Red-Black Trees have the following properties:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Binary Search Tree Property</strong>: Like all binary search trees,
          a Red-Black Tree satisfies the binary search tree property, meaning that
          for each node:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All nodes in its left subtree have keys less than its key.</li>
          <li>All nodes in its right subtree have keys greater than its key.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Red-Black Properties</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each node is colored, either red or black.</li>
          <li>The root node is always black.</li>
          <li>Every leaf (NIL) is considered black.</li>
          <li>If a red node has a red child, then its parent must be black. In other
            words, no two red nodes can be adjacent along any path.</li>
          <li>For each node, any simple path from this node to any of its descendant
            leaves has the same number of black nodes. This property ensures that the
            tree remains approximately balanced.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The balancing properties of Red-Black Trees make sure that the longest
          path from the root to a leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest
          path. This guarantees that the tree remains balanced, and the worst-case
          time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and search
          is O(log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Red-Black Trees are widely used in many programming languages and libraries
          to implement data structures like associative arrays (maps and dictionaries)
          and as a foundation for more advanced data structures like AVL trees and
          B-trees. They are particularly useful in situations where you need to maintain
          a sorted collection of data while performing frequent insertions and deletions.</p>
