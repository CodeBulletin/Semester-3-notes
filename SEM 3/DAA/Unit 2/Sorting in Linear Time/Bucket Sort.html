       <h1>Bucket Sort</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that is particularly useful when you
          have a set of uniformly distributed input values over a known range. It
          divides the input array into a fixed number of "buckets," each of which
          is then sorted individually, either using another sorting algorithm or
          by recursively applying bucket sort. The sorted buckets are then concatenated
          to produce the final sorted output.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a high-level overview of the Bucket Sort algorithm:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Determine the range</strong>: Find the minimum and maximum values
            in the input array to determine the range of values.</li>
          <li><strong>Create buckets</strong>: Divide the range of values into a fixed
            number of equally sized buckets. The number of buckets and their size may
            vary depending on the specific implementation and the characteristics of
            the input data.</li>
          <li><strong>Scatter the elements</strong>: Iterate through the input array
            and place each element into the appropriate bucket. To determine the correct
            bucket for each element, you can use a simple formula like <strong>(value - min) / bucket_size</strong>,
            where "value" is the value of the element, "min" is the minimum value in
            the input, and "bucket_size" is the size of each bucket.</li>
          <li><strong>Sort each bucket</strong>: For each non-empty bucket, sort its
            elements using a suitable sorting algorithm. This can be done recursively
            using bucket sort or by using another sorting method like insertion sort.</li>
          <li><strong>Concatenate the sorted buckets</strong>: After sorting each bucket,
            concatenate them in order to obtain the final sorted array.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Bucket Sort has an average-case time complexity of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(n+\frac{n^2}k+k)\)</span>,
          where "<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>" is the number of elements,
          "<span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span>" is the number of buckets, and the
          term&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac {n^2} k\)</span>&nbsp;represents
          the time it takes to sort each bucket. The algorithm can perform quite
          well when the input data is evenly distributed among the buckets, and the
          number of buckets is chosen appropriately.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">def bucket_sort(arr, num_buckets):
