       <h1>Radix Sort</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that processes
          the input data by processing individual digits or characters of each element.
          It works by distributing elements into buckets based on their individual
          digits, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) and moving
          towards the most significant digit (leftmost). After processing each digit
          position, the elements are collected back in order.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Radix Sort works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Determine the maximum number of digits</strong>: Find the maximum
            number of digits in the input numbers. This determines how many passes
            the algorithm will make.</li>
          <li><strong>Initialize ten buckets (0-9)</strong> for each digit position.
            These buckets are used to temporarily store elements based on the current
            digit being examined.</li>
          <li><strong>For each pass, distribute elements into the buckets</strong>:
            Starting from the least significant digit (rightmost), distribute each
            element into one of the ten buckets based on the value of the current digit.
            Elements with the same digit go into the same bucket. After distributing
            all elements, collect them back from the buckets in the order they were
            placed.</li>
          <li>Repeat step 3 for each digit position, moving from right to left.</li>
          <li>After processing all digit positions, the input array will be sorted.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Radix Sort has a time complexity of O(<span class="math-tex">\(O(k * n)\)</span>),
          where "k" is the number of digits in the maximum number, and "n" is the
          number of elements in the input array. It is a stable sorting algorithm
          and is often used for sorting integers or fixed-length strings.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">import math

    if max_val != 0:
    	max_digits = math.ceil(math.log10(max_val))  # number of digits of an integer is ceil(log(x)) for x &gt;= 1 else 0

        # Initialize ten buckets (0-9)
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(10)]

        arr = [num for bucket in buckets for num in bucket]

arr = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
