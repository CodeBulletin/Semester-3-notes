       <h1>Rabin-Karp Algorithm</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The core idea of the Rabin-Karp algorithm is to hash the pattern and compare
          the hash value of the pattern with the hash values of substrings of the
          text. If the hash values match, it means there is a potential match, and
          the algorithm performs a character-by-character comparison to confirm the
          match. If there is no match, the algorithm shifts the window one position
          to the right and recalculates the hash value.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Here's how the Rabin-Karp algorithm works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Preprocessing</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Compute the hash value of the pattern.</li>
              <li>Create a rolling hash function that allows you to update the hash value
                of a substring efficiently as you slide the window over the text. This
                function should enable you to add the next character and remove the previous
                character's contribution to the hash in constant time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Searching</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Compute the hash value of the first window (substring) of the text that
                is the same length as the pattern.</li>
              <li>Compare the hash value of this window with the hash value of the pattern.</li>
              <li>If the hash values match, perform a character-by-character comparison
                to confirm the match.</li>
              <li>If they don't match, slide the window one position to the right and recalculate
                the hash value for the new window.</li>
              <li>Repeat this process until you reach the end of the text or find a full
                match of the pattern.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Rabin-Karp algorithm's efficiency depends on the choice of hash function
          and how you handle hash collisions. Collisions can occur if two different
          substrings have the same hash value. To handle this, the algorithm should
          recheck the character-by-character match in case of a collision.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The Rabin-Karp algorithm is known for its average-case and worst-case
          time complexity of O(n + m) in most scenarios, where n is the length of
          the text and m is the length of the pattern. However, in the worst-case
          scenario where hash collisions are frequent, it may degrade to O(n * m).
          Despite this worst-case scenario, the Rabin-Karp algorithm can be quite
          efficient for many practical applications.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">def rabin_karp(text, pattern):
