        <p style="margin-left:0px;">String matching with finite automata is a technique used to search for
          occurrences of a pattern (substring) within a larger text by constructing
          a finite automaton that recognizes the pattern. This approach is efficient
          and can be especially useful when you need to search for the same pattern
          in multiple texts.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The steps involved in string matching with finite automata are as follows:</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Preprocessing Phase (Pattern to DFA):</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes the pattern.
              This DFA is constructed based on the characters in the pattern.</li>
            <li>The DFA has states and transitions between states, where each state represents
              a certain state of the pattern matching process.</li>
            <li>Transitions are determined by the characters in the pattern. For each
              state, a transition is defined for each character that could come next
              in the pattern.</li>
            <li>The final state(s) of the DFA indicate a successful match of the pattern.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Searching Phase (Text to DFA):</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start at the initial state of the DFA.</li>
            <li>For each character in the text:
              <ul>
                <li>Follow the transition corresponding to that character in the DFA.</li>
                <li>If a match is found (the automaton reaches a final state), report the
                  position of the match in the text.</li>
                <li>Continue to process the next character in the text.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
