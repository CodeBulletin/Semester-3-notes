       <h1>Median And Order Statistics</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Median:</strong> The median is a statistical measure that represents
          the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered. In a dataset with an
          odd number of values, the median is the middle value. In a dataset with
          an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">For example, in the dataset [1, 3, 5], the median is 3 because it's the
          middle value. In the dataset [1, 3, 5, 7], the median is (3 + 5) / 2 =
          4 because there are two middle values (3 and 5), and their average is 4.</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0px;">The median is a measure of central tendency, and it is often used when
            dealing with data that may have outliers because it is less affected by
            extreme values than the mean.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Order Statistics:</strong> Order statistics refer to finding the
              k-th smallest (or largest) element in a dataset. The k-th order statistic
              is essentially the k-th element when the dataset is sorted in either ascending
              or descending order. Order statistics include finding the minimum (k =
              1), maximum (k = n, where n is the number of elements), median (k = n/2
              for even n, or k = (n+1)/2 for odd n), or any other specific position within
              the ordered dataset.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:0px;">For example, given the dataset [7, 2, 9, 1, 6], the 3rd order statistic
              would be 6 because it's the 3rd smallest element when the data is sorted.</p>
            <p
            style="margin-left:0px;">Order statistics problems are common in computer science and algorithms,
              and they have various applications, such as finding the median of a dataset,
              selecting the top k elements in a list, or identifying the k-th smallest
              or largest element in a collection.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:0px;">Algorithms for finding order statistics can vary in complexity and efficiency.
                Some well-known algorithms include quickselect, which is based on the quicksort
                algorithm, and the use of binary search trees or min-heap data structures
                to efficiently find order statistics.</p>
