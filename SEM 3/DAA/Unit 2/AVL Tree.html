        <p style="margin-left:0px;">An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree
          remains balanced to maintain efficient operations such as searching, insertion,
          and deletion. The name "AVL" stands for the initials of the inventors,
          Adelson-Velsky and Landis.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">In an AVL tree, each node has a balance factor associated with it, which
          is the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees. The
          balance factor can be either -1, 0, or 1. The tree is considered balanced
          if the balance factor of every node is in the range of -1 to 1.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Whenever an insertion or deletion operation is performed that may disturb
          the balance of the tree, AVL trees employ rotation operations to rebalance
          the tree. Rotations are applied to adjust the heights of the subtrees and
          maintain the balance factor of each node.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The self-balancing property of AVL trees ensures that the height of the
          tree remains logarithmic in the number of nodes, resulting in efficient
          operations with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of
          elements in the tree.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The balance factor calculation and rotation operations make AVL trees
          slightly more complex than regular binary search trees, but they provide
          a guaranteed balanced structure that offers consistent performance for
          various operations.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">An AVL tree has several important properties:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Balanced Structure</strong>: In an AVL tree, the heights of the
            left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1. This ensures a
            balanced structure and guarantees that the tree remains relatively shallow,
            resulting in efficient operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Balance Factor</strong>: Each node in an AVL tree stores a balance
            factor, which is the difference between the height of its left subtree
            and the height of its right subtree. The balance factor can be -1, 0, or
            1. By maintaining balance factors, AVL trees can determine when and where
            rotations are needed to restore balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Balancing Operations</strong>: Whenever an insertion or deletion
            operation is performed that may disrupt the balance of the tree, AVL trees
            employ rotation operations to restore balance. There are four rotation
            operations: Left-Left (LL), Right-Right (RR), Left-Right (LR), and Right-Left
            (RL). These rotations adjust the heights of subtrees and maintain the balance
            factor of each node.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient Search, Insertion, and Deletion</strong>: Due to their
            balanced nature, AVL trees provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion
            operations with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of
            nodes in the tree. This time complexity remains consistent regardless of
            the distribution of the data.</li>
          <li><strong>Unique Key Values</strong>: AVL trees are typically used for storing
            unique key-value pairs, where each key in the tree is unique. If a duplicate
            key is attempted to be inserted into an AVL tree, it would either be rejected
            or an appropriate action can be taken based on the specific implementation.</li>
          <li><strong>Additional Memory Overhead</strong>: AVL trees require extra memory
            to store the balance factors for each node, in addition to the key and
            value. This additional memory overhead compared to regular binary search
            trees is necessary to maintain the self-balancing property.</li>
