       <h1>Sorting in Linear Time</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, and Radix Sort are sorting algorithms that
          can achieve linear time complexity under specific conditions.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Counting Sort</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time Complexity: O(n + k), where n is the number of elements to be sorted,
            and k is the range of the input values.</li>
          <li>Counting Sort is most efficient when sorting a range of integers, and
            it works well when the range of input values (k) is not significantly larger
            than the number of elements (n). It is a stable sorting algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Bucket Sort</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time Complexity: O(n + n^2/k + k), where n is the number of elements to
            be sorted, k is the number of buckets, and n^2/k is the time complexity
            of sorting elements within each bucket.</li>
          <li>Bucket Sort is effective when the input values are uniformly distributed
            and the number of buckets (k) is chosen appropriately. The time complexity
            can be linear if these conditions are met.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Radix Sort</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time Complexity: O(w * (n + k)), where n is the number of elements to
            be sorted, k is the range of input values, and w is the number of digits
            in the maximum number.</li>
          <li>Radix Sort is useful for sorting integers or fixed-size strings. It sorts
            by examining the digits or characters in each element. The time complexity
            can be linear when w is a constant or has a small value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">It's important to note that these linear time complexities are achieved
          under certain assumptions and constraints, and they may not always be the
          best choice for sorting, depending on the specific characteristics of the
          input data. The choice of sorting algorithm should consider the nature
          of the data and the specific requirements of the problem at hand.</p>
