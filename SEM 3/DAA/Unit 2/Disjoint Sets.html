       <h1>Disjoint Sets</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Disjoint sets, often referred to as disjoint sets or disjoint set data
          structures, are a fundamental concept in computer science and data structure
          theory. They are used to manage a collection of sets such that no element
          belongs to more than one set within the collection. The primary operations
          associated with disjoint sets are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>MakeSet(x):</strong> This operation creates a new set containing
            element x. Initially, each element is in its own individual set.</li>
          <li><strong>Union(x, y):</strong> This operation combines two sets that contain
            elements x and y, respectively, into a single set, effectively merging
            them. The two original sets become subsets of the new, larger set.&nbsp;
            <br>Time Complexity:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(log n)\)</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Find(x):</strong> This operation is used to determine which set
            an element x belongs to. It returns a representative element of the set
            containing x, which is often used to identify and compare sets.
            <br>Time Complexity:&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(logn)\)</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">Disjoint sets are used in various algorithms and applications, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm:</strong> Disjoint sets
            are used to keep track of the connected components of a graph and to efficiently
            find edges that do not form cycles in the minimum spanning tree.</li>
          <li><strong>Connected Components in Graphs:</strong> Disjoint sets help find
            connected components in a graph quickly, making it possible to determine
            which nodes are in the same connected component.</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic Equivalence Relations:</strong> Disjoint sets can be used
            to maintain equivalence relations among elements. For example, in a set
            of elements, you can use disjoint sets to determine if two elements are
            in the same equivalence class or not.</li>
          <li><strong>Set Partitioning:</strong> Disjoint sets are used to partition
            a set into non-overlapping subsets or clusters, which can be useful in
            various clustering algorithms.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The data structure and algorithms for disjoint sets are designed to be
          efficient, with various optimizations such as path compression and union
          by rank to ensure fast execution. Disjoint set data structures can be implemented
          using arrays, linked lists, or trees, depending on the specific algorithm
          and requirements.</p>
