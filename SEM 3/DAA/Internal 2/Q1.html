        <h2>(a) Define Omega notation.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Omega notation (Ω) is used in computer science to describe the lower bound
          of an algorithm's running time. It provides a guarantee that the algorithm
          will take at least this amount of time to complete. For example, if an
          algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n^2), it means that the execution
          time will not be less than a constant times n^2 for sufficiently large
          n.</p>
        <p>For a function&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(f(n)\)</span>,&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(\Omega(g(n))\)</span>&nbsp;represents an lower bound on its growth.
            This means that there exists a constant&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(c &gt; 0\)</span>&nbsp;and
            an input size&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n_0\)</span>&nbsp;such that&nbsp;
            <span
            class="math-tex">\(f(n)\)</span>&nbsp;is bounded bellow by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(c *g(n) \space \forall \space n \ge n_0\)</span>
        </p>
        <h2>(b) Derive the worst case complexity of the quick sort algorithm.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. In the worst case, it occurs
          when the pivot element is the smallest or the largest element in the list,
          leading to unbalanced partitions. In such cases, the time complexity becomes&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(O(n^2)\)</span>. However, with a good pivot selection method, like choosing
            the median, the average complexity can be&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(O(n log n)\)</span>.</p>

        <h2>(c) State the general principle of greedy method.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>The greedy method is an algorithmic approach that makes the best choice
          at each step as it attempts to find the global optimum. It follows the
          problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each
          stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. Greedy algorithms are
          known for their efficiency and are used in problems like the shortest path,
          minimum spanning tree, and Huffman coding</p>
        <p>Overall, greedy algorithms can be a useful tool for solving certain types
          of problems efficiently, but they may not always provide the optimal solution.
          It is important to carefully analyze the problem and consider alternative
          approaches when using greedy algorithms.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">Greedy(a, n) {

        <h2>(d) Explain how reliability of a system is determined using dynamic programming?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Dynamic programming can be used to enhance system reliability by optimizing
          the redundancy and allocation of resources. The approach typically involves
          breaking down the reliability problem into smaller subproblems, solving
          each subproblem just once, and storing these solutions for future reference.
          The optimal solution of the larger problem is then constructed from these
          sub-solutions.</p>

        <h2>(e) Explain the Hamiltonian circuit problem with an example.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>A Hamiltonian circuit is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly
          once and returns to the starting vertex. For example, in a graph of five
          vertices arranged in a pentagon, a Hamiltonian circuit would involve starting
          at one vertex and visiting each of the other four vertices once before
          returning to the starting vertex.</p>
        <p>(note there maybe more than 1 Hamiltonian circuit in a graph or there
          maybe no Hamiltonian circuit)&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>(f) What is amortized analysis of algorithms and how is it different from asymptotic analysis?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Amortized analysis is a method used to average the time complexity of
          a sequence of operations in an algorithm over all the operations performed.
          It differs from asymptotic analysis, which describes the complexity in
          terms of the input size, often focusing on the worst-case scenario. Amortized
          analysis provides a more precise understanding of the algorithm's performance
          in practice.</p>
        <h2>(g) Formulate 8-queens problem.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>he 8-Queens problem involves placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard
          such that no two queens threaten each other. The challenge is that no two
          queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem is a classic
          example of the more general n-queens problem of placing n queens on an
          n×n chessboard.</p>
        <h2>(h) Discuss the importance of knapsack algorithm in our daily life?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>The knapsack problem, where one must maximize the total value of items
          in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity, has practical applications
          in resource allocation, budget management, and logistics. In daily life,
          it can be used for decision-making in situations like selecting the most
          valuable items to pack for a trip within a limited space.</p>
        <h2>(i) Define Optimal binary search tree with an example.&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>n optimal binary search tree is a binary search tree where the nodes are
          arranged on levels such that the tree cost (the sum of the search costs
          of all elements) is minimized. For example, if you have nodes with different
          probabilities of being searched, arranging them in an optimal BST minimizes
          the total search cost.</p>
