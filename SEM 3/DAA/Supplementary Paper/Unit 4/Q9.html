        <h2>(a) Define terms: P-Class, NP-Class, NP-Hard and NP-Complete.</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>P (Polynomial Time)</strong>: P is the class of decision problems
            that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
            These are problems that have efficient algorithms for their solution.</li>
          <li><strong>NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)</strong>: NP is the class
            of decision problems that can be verified in polynomial time. While finding
            a solution to an NP problem may be difficult, given a potential solution,
            it can be efficiently verified. The question of whether P = NP, i.e., whether
            every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time, is one of the most
            important open problems in computer science.</li>
          <li><strong>NP-complete</strong>: NP-complete is a subset of NP problems that
            are considered to be among the most difficult problems in NP. A problem
            is NP-complete if every other problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial
            time. If a polynomial-time algorithm is found for any NP-complete problem,
            it would imply that P = NP.</li>
          <li><strong>NP-hard</strong>: NP-hard is a class of problems that are at least
            as difficult as the NP-complete problems. While NP-complete problems are
            a subset of NP-hard problems, NP-hard problems may or may not be in NP.
            They represent problems that are computationally challenging and do not
            necessarily have efficient solutions.</li>
