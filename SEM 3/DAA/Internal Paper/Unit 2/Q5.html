        <h2>(a) Examine Divide and Conquer paradigm of problem solving</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Divide and Conquer approach is a problem-solving technique used in
          various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and algorithms.
          It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable
          subproblems, solving those subproblems independently, and then combining
          their solutions to solve the original problem. The key idea is to divide
          a problem into smaller parts, conquer each part, and then combine the results.</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0px;">The Divide and Conquer approach typically consists of three main steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Divide</strong>: The problem is divided into smaller, often equal-sized,
              subproblems. This division continues until the subproblems are simple enough
              to be solved directly. The goal is to break the problem into smaller, more
              manageable pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Conquer</strong>: Each subproblem is solved independently. This
              can involve applying the same Divide and Conquer approach recursively to
              further subdivide the subproblems until they become trivial to solve. In
              some cases, the subproblems are solved using other techniques, such as
              brute force or dynamic programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong>: The solutions to the subproblems are combined
              to obtain a solution for the original problem. This step can involve aggregating
              results, merging data, or performing additional computations as needed.</li>
          </ol>
          <p style="margin-left:0px;">The Divide and Conquer approach is widely used in algorithm design and
            optimization. Common examples of algorithms that use this technique include
            merge sort, quicksort, binary search, and many others. These algorithms
            divide a problem into smaller parts, solve them independently, and then
            combine the results to achieve efficient solutions. Divide and Conquer
            is especially valuable for solving problems with a high time complexity
            by reducing them to simpler problems with lower time complexities.</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">DAC(p) {
